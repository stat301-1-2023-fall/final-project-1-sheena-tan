mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,It was a good introduction to Civil Engineering. It was nice to get to know a lot of CIVE professors.
mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,This seminar was really interesting to learn about the Professors in this department and what they do. It was hard to stay awake sometimes because of the time.
mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,The course is basically coming in every week to hear different professors in the CEE department discuss their research and courses they teach. It definitely helped me prepare for what to expect during my time at Northwestern and the free pizza was a bonus!
mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,This was a good introduction to civil and environmental engineering without a large time commitment.
mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,Did exactly what is said it would.
mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,"This course is very chill and I'd recommend it to anyone slightly interested in CivE or EnvE. Every week you go in Wednesday evening, grab free pizza and soda, and just listen to a guest speaker about various topics in CivE/EnvE for ~50 mins. No work outside of class meeting time. Sure, some of the guest lectures can be boring/uninteresting, but this course helped me solidify my commitment to CEE."
mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,pizza class goes crazy
mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,"This seminar was very chill and extremely helpful in furthering my understanding of civil and environmental engineers. Each week, a different civil or environmental engineering professor gave an hour presentation on a different topic related to civil or environmental engineering. Some of these topics included water infrastructure and how it relates to underserved communities, designing sustainable communities, and mobility innovation. Definitely take this course if you are planning on majoring in civil or environmental engineering or are interested in majoring in either of the two majors. This seminar had no work and was a nice break from all of my other classes my freshman year fall quarter, we also got free food every week and I met so many other civil and environmental engineers! Take this seminar!"
mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,It was a very interesting class every week with a variety of speakers that covered all of civil and environmental engineering. It was very helpful in my own quest to decide if I should switch to one of these majors providing a look at the many options for work and the application of skill.
mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,"I really enjoyed this class. It was honestly the only class that I was actually excited to attend each week and I felt like I could decompress and just listen to the material for pure enjoyment. It was great and each of the presenters were really interesting and I loved hearing about their work. Even though it was only one hour each week, I felt like I was still really productive in class because I was actually learning about the things I love."
mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,"This was a very cool seminar. Every week, a civil or environmental engineering professor would tell us about their work. It was interesting to see the different ways civil and environmental engineers are solving societal problems today, especially those related to sustainability. If you want to do so, this seminar would be a good opportunity to network with professors and see what research you would be interested in. Also, attendance is optional, there are no assignments, and there's free pizza every time. Honestly see no reason not to take it."
mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,"This was a very laid back and interesting seminar that allowed me to see the bigger picture of where my study plan was heading for careers in the future. It was a nice break from the more stressful engineering classes and inspired me even more to stick with the field. No work outside of class, lots of passionate guest speakers."
mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,Always looked forward to this seminar. All of the Professors who spoke were interactive and entertaining.
mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,Interesting seminar on civil engineering where each lecture is a presentation by a faculty member on a civE project or interest of theirs.
mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,"I had a positive experience. The time commitment was an hour a week, and it was very enjoyable. It was great to look at the big picture and learn more about how engineering principles were applied in the real world."

mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,This is a great way to learn more about career options post–grad and see if you are truly interested in the field. You meet once a week and there are no assignments. We also had free pizza every class!
mcmk,civ_env,101,fall,David Corr,5.60,5.51,5.26,3.80,5.60,3.00,"This course was a series of lectures I found interesting and helped me decide more clearly what concentration of engineering I might be interested in.

mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,This class was intriguing but a lot more work than expected. Do not fall behind the assignments because they will rack up. The professor was very nice and had interesting lectures.
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"This course was honestly sort of a pain. It is largely based on a group project and thus completely dependent on what group you are assigned how easy the process goes for you. It is not difficult to do well on the personal assignments and quizzes if you pay attention in class; however, I didn't really see the cross over between the economic principles the class seemed to focus on and the civil engineering field."
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"Very chill class, up until the last week or two. You should definitely get your group to start researching for the final presentation EARLY so you don't get caught in the end with no resources. The course topic is interesting, and if you like Econ or Urban Planning, Stats, Analytics, whatever, it's an exciting class. Prof. Stathopoulos is amazing, always willing to help students out even though I could tell she had a lot on her plate."
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"This course has a lot of good stuff in it. Thinking back on the class, there are a lot of pieces that will apply to diverse situations. I am more aware of the world now. Prof. Stathopoulos is great, and there are a lot of interesting questions posed."
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"I was really excited about this class going in, but ended up being disappointed. Smart cities are a really interesting and relevant topic, but I felt like this class was kind of a wasted opportunity because of how repetitive and unengaging it was. You basically do the same assignments over and over again, you talk a lot about data analysis and economics, and the group project that you do throughout the quarter is unfortunately reminiscent of DTC. Its not a terribly hard class but just not very interesting and felt like a lot of time is wasted."
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"This course will teach you about big data, its applications and ethical considerations. You will also have to do a group project where you'll apply data and things you learn in class. Overall a solid course but be prepared to spend a bit of time with data analysis and mapping. Some topics might be more interesting than others depending on your passions."
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"This class is very innovative, and not hard at all. However, the professor does set up the class in an economics way which is a little frustrating just because this class is centered around engineering innovations"
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"I think this course is a great supplement for design courses. The content is very useful for future work. Interesting class as well. As long as you engage, participate, and ask questions, grades shouldn't be a stressor."
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,This course was pretty good I feel like I learned a lot about the world of smart cities as well as evaluating how good or bad different technologies are. I don't think I learned that much in this course and I definitely don't feel like an expert but it's good exposure to the topic of using technology to improve cities or at least some theories behind it.
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"201 is a great class that blends together city planning theories, data analysis, engineering ethics, and smart technoloiges. The group project gives you an opportunity to explore one of these issues more in–depth without an overwhelming amount of assignments."
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"This was the first class I have ever taken that I genuinely didn't like. The class was not hard, but it was unengaging and overall felt very fluffy. The class was a weird mix of discussion and lecture. I never found the slides helpful they were not very readable and overall too busy. I liked most of the readings but discussions were lack luster."
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,My biggest annoyance was that the professor was late almost everyday and was unable to adapt well when technology didn't work. She also didn't have great time management and groups would miss out on feedback as a result. The lateness wouldn't be an issue but the class is heavily attendance based and she would routinely keep us after class to sign a piece of paper to prove we were there. I found this to be inconsiderate of our time and borderline disrespectful.
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"this class is a lot of work but you will get a good grade and its not too difficult and the content is pretty interesting and i feel like i definitely learned a lot though my one complaint is that i didnt really like the organization of the course. although it was a lot of work, i think the teamwork project did help us apply lessons learned in lecture to an actual project so that was cool."
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,pleasantly surprised to learn of so many areas where civil engineers can apply their knowledge in a way that improves human living
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"Professor Stathopoulos is a great professor and I enjoyed this class. It is a little tough to understand at times because there is a lot of fancy vocabulary used that makes the class a little confusing at times, but overall I am happy I took this class. I learned a lot about analytics, ethic, and decision–making all in the context of smart cities. I liked the format of the class as well because you can succeed and learn at the same time."
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,We did a project over the course of the quarter which was interesting and helped me learn about the class more indepth than some of the class itself
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"Really interesting class. Stathopoulos is a great professor and has very engaging lectures and covers many different topics. The workload is manageable, though you have to stay on top of a quarter–long group project, but it is not too bad. Recommend this class!"
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"This was a fun overview of smart cities and decision science. This included study of traditional city planning, modern smart city technology, effects of algorithms and big data, ethics, and decision science (cost–benefit analysis, multi–criteria analysis, etc). There was also a quarter–long project in which groups formulated and proposed smart city solutions of their own."
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"This course was like mini econ for engineers. Some people love it, some don’t. I personally didn’t connect with the material, but that doesn’t matter too much in the long run. The prof was super super sweet and accommodating but the lectures were just a bit dry."
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"This course gave me a completely different perspective of engineering and introduced to idea of engineering as decision–making in smart cities. As opposed to technical knowledge, the focus on research, decision frameworks, and ethics made smart cities a much more in–depth topic than I initially thought. I'm now more interested in smart cities and the connection between big data and how cities plan for the future. The teams we worked in throughout the quarter gave a sense of growth that went alongside our in–class learning. The three individual reports were each very unique and the quizzes were manageable and open–note. The readings were interesting and disgestible yet very relevant to the history and current state of smart city thinking. Professor Stathopoulos is very knowledgeable and willing to listen to and question your ideas, which makes you feel like a contributor to the academic conversation surrounding smart cities by the end of the course."
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"I liked the material taught in the course, however I didn't like the approach the teacher had because it was focused on economics and financial stuff that I didn't have previous knowledge on so it was very confusing and hard to understand because it seemed like she expected you to already know certain topics. The class felt more like a review than teaching."
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"Overall, I really liked this course. All of the readings and course materials were very interesting and useful. The assignments were also very interesting to do."
mcmk,civ_env,201,winter,Amanda Blomberg Stathopoulos,4.84,4.57,4.29,4.10,4.65,4.82,"This course is required, but it overall wasn't bad. It was obvious the teacher cared alot about the subject and knew a lot, however some of the grading was a little harsh and arbitrary. A lot of the class is also dependent on how good your group is and how much effort they are willing to put into the class. Some of the ethical discussions were interesting though."
mcmk,civ_env,202,fall,Erica Hartmann,5.58,5.42,4.67,4.03,5.55,3.61,"Very fun class, Prof. Hartman is the goat"
mcmk,civ_env,202,fall,Erica Hartmann,5.58,5.42,4.67,4.03,5.55,3.61,"Really cool course. In regards to grades, the professor is there to help you succeed. As long as you ask for help, your grades should be fine. Amazing class discussions. Learned a lot. 10/10, would recommend it to everyone."
mcmk,civ_env,202,fall,Erica Hartmann,5.58,5.42,4.67,4.03,5.55,3.61,"This class is more of a community–builder than a genuine engineering class which felt like a breath of fresh air. Erica allows you to run with your creativity and make the class your own. At the end of the quarter, the class felt like more of a home than a class and I'm so happy I took this!"
mcmk,civ_env,202,fall,Erica Hartmann,5.58,5.42,4.67,4.03,5.55,3.61,This was a great course and I learned a lot about applying different topics to real word problems. Harttman was a great teacher and I loved her so much! Her course is very laid back but you also have fun and learn so much! The homework are doable and based on readings and class conversations. The OpEd at the end is very interesting and fun to write if you choose a topic that is interesting to you! I would 100% recommend you guys to take this class!
mcmk,civ_env,202,fall,Erica Hartmann,5.58,5.42,4.67,4.03,5.55,3.61,Amazing. Love. Would take again
mcmk,civ_env,202,fall,Erica Hartmann,5.58,5.42,4.67,4.03,5.55,3.61,"This course is a great way to think about the implications of applied biology and ecology in our modern world, through lenses of case studies and various fields with offshoots in medicine, genetics, population studies, pure biology, ecology, and more. I feel a better, more informed global citizen for having taken this class."
mcmk,civ_env,202,fall,Erica Hartmann,5.58,5.42,4.67,4.03,5.55,3.61,"I have mixed feelings on this course. In the classroom, I really enjoyed it I loved all our discussions and I really like the selections of readings for class. The homeworks were really annoying though, for a lot of them the questions would be nothing like what we discussed in class and I couldn't find the answers in the textbook either. I feel like instead of a lot of those multiple choice homeworks with weird questions we should've just had short answer questions that deal with critical thinking, and that would be much more relevant to what the course is about. Also I wish the professor posted onto canvas the things discussed in class on what to expect for the midterms and a more detailed rubric for the final paper. Despite some negatives this class was a lot of fun and pretty easy and I really liked the professor."

mcmk,civ_env,202,fall,Erica Hartmann,5.58,5.42,4.67,4.03,5.55,3.61,This was a good course. I learned a lot of things I would have never known about and while it isn't the most math–based engineering course I actually think I'll personally end up taking away ore things from this class than other heavy math engineering classes.Do the readings if you can– they're pretty interesting and make the discussions more useful.
mcmk,civ_env,202,fall,Erica Hartmann,5.58,5.42,4.67,4.03,5.55,3.61,"Civ Env 202 is really great beyond just meeting a basic science requirement for many majors. You learn a lot of new developments in ecology and biological technology like gene editing, cloning and CRISPR, not just the typical high school Biology concepts. Class is always fun and a very fair workload."
mcmk,civ_env,202,fall,Erica Hartmann,5.58,5.42,4.67,4.03,5.55,3.61,The topics covered in class were interesting and we had fun discussions as well as a mock trial (extra credit) towards the end. As long as you pay attention in class you will do okay in exams. A lot of the exam questions will be based on discussions from class. The final assignment is a short op–ed where you can choose any topic related to something that was covered in class.
mcmk,civ_env,202,fall,Erica Hartmann,5.58,5.42,4.67,4.03,5.55,3.61,Great class with lots of relevant topics! Weekly homework quizzes based on the textbook and daily readings that were interesting. Two low–stress midterms and a short paper final.

I do not think that every engineering course needs to be super challenging. This class had important ecological readings and discussions which added to my knowledge of civil and environmental engineering."

mcmk,civ_env,202,fall,Erica Hartmann,5.58,5.42,4.67,4.03,5.55,3.61,This course was pretty chill. The professor was real nice and kept the class engaging. Attend class and do the canvas homework and you'll be good. No sweat
mcmk,civ_env,202,fall,Erica Hartmann,5.58,5.42,4.67,4.03,5.55,3.61,Great tech elective class. Low time commitment and Prof. Hartmann is great. Exams are easy and only require minimal studying. Much more focussed on in–class discussions than learning facts.
mcmk,civ_env,202,fall,Erica Hartmann,5.58,5.42,4.67,4.03,5.55,3.61,"This class was interesting, low–pressure, and enjoyable. Prof. Hartmann is both very knowledgeable and fun.

Take this class if you want a brief overview of the different climate and environmental engineering problems going on in the world!"
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"I really enjoyed this course with Prof. Blair. I really liked how he focused on current events in this class, it made it feel fresh and relevant with a clear focus on how climate change is impacting our everyday lives today. The quizzes felt pretty fair, I went to class and reviewed the lectures beforehand, and some of them were a little hard / required remembering pretty specific facts from lectures, but my grades evened out in the end. If you're looking for a McCormick basic science class, this is it!"
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"I would highly highly recommend this class. I learned so much, professor Blair is so amazing. He is so educated and truely cares about the subject so much. The class structure is set up for students success."
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,I really enjoyed this class. It was very interesting and I enjoyed learning from Professor Blair. I think the quizzes were pretty fair and I definitely did learn some interesting things from the homework. The class was quite depressing though.
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,Weekly quizzes that directly relate to the lecture material and a 30–minute research article analysis every week. Blair is great. Really cares about the material and provides exciting articles in class.
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"Pretty interesting class. I feel like weekly quizzes were graded a bit harsh (seems too all or nothing) but if you watch the lectures, takes notes, and review you’ll be fine."
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,The weekly quizzes start to creep up and I was personally tempted to give this class the absolute minimum effort which kinda came back to bite me in the end. If you don't mind studying even a little each week you will do just fine. Pretty fun class overall and I did enjoy the content.
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,I took this for my natural science distro and it is a good course. You take weekly quizzes over the content from that week. Everything is straightforward and very relevant to our lives. I recommend.
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"This was a lovely course. I took it for basic science. There is just one simple, quick assignment and one quiz per week. The quiz on Friday is based on Monday and Wednesday's lecture, which are recorded, so quickly rewatching them the morning of is sufficient to study. The quizzes aren't trying to trick you, but also aren't trivial, and you need an understanding of the week's key concepts to do well. Prof. Blair's clear passion for the topic made lecture pretty entertaining, along with his sense of humor (like how he would congratulate us on rising CO2 levels). I would recommend this course to anyone for basic science (but I did prefer EARTH 203)."
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,Great class! Very good to take for any background as we should all know the scale of climate change.
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,Best McCormick distro. Easy A if you have good notes.
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,This course is pretty manageable alongside other courses that may take up more of your time. It'd be pretty helpful to review the course content after each lecture. When completing the homework make sure to use the citations from the pdf of the article and match it exactly (or else the graders will take off points)!
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"As someone who’s always been interested in ecological issues, I really enjoyed this class. I learned a ton of interesting facts about the Earth and how we’ve done a great job of messing it up (as well as possible solutions). The weekly quizzes require a decent amount of studying, but it you rewatch the lectures and practice asking yourself questions about the info each week, you’ll be good!"
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"Prof Blair is the GOAT, but make sure you attend and take notes during lecture because a majority of your grade depends on the weekly quizzes."
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"great class, you learn some really important things and it makes you think. pretty easy to get a good grade"
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,I thoroughly enjoyed this course!
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"Class grade based on weekly ""literature searches"" and quizzes, both of which are quite easy to handle, especially if you attend class. I found lecture to be quite interesting, as Blair was clearly passionate about the subject."
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"This class is really interesting and informative, and I think its a super important class to take because you learn all about what's causing climate change and can actually understand the impact of your actions. The weekly quizzes aren't stressful and are a good way to review the information you learned that week. The homework assignments are pretty quick. The one thing I disliked about the class is that we spent very little time talking about what could be done to fix these issues, which made it really hard to stay positive towards the end. The class can be a little depressing at times so it would be nice to have more of a focus in the end about what we can do about it."
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,Good course overall. It was an interesting but easy natural science credit.
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,Take this just take this
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"The class allowed me to understand the extents to which climate change is affecting the Earth and how everyone should be involved in the fight to save our planet. During class, Prof. Neal tries to make the class interesting by displaying live feeds that correspond to the week's theme. He is also very flexible and gives make up quizzes if you can't make it to the weekly quizzes. Overall, the class was enjoyable and I would highly recommend this as a basic science course."
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"Incredible professor who is super passionate and up to date on modern environmental issues. Prof. Blair is also really kind and understanding and will work with you if you miss something for an extenuating circumstances. No large exams, but weekly quizzes."
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"This was a fun course. Learning about different systems in the Earth and how we humans have changed them over time and how we fix the impending issues. Prof. Blair has a very fair course policy imo. 70% across ~10 weekly quizzes and 30%across ~ 10 literature searches. Take very detailed notes in lecture adn pay attention in discussions. Do a quick review of your notes the day before the quiz and the day of and you'll be good.Lit searches aren't too hard once you find a concise, interesting article. Overall a great course that got an applause from my class on the last day."
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,Really nice class. weekly quizzes need to study for but they arent that bad. Content is really interesting and relevant
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,AMAZING COURSE. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. The professor was incredibly sweet and enthusiastic. The material was actually interesting. You didn't actually have to go to class– just watch the recorded lectures and show up on Friday for the weekly quiz. 100% take this class if you can
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,Would recommend craming for quizzes and not taking the class seriously.
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,Absolutely loved this course. Dr. Blair is great and really passionate about making us want to make a change. I think everyone who is able to should take this class because it actually talks about the real impact of climate change at a much deeper level than we usually think about. The weekly quizzes aren't bad at all – just be sure to watch the lectures before – and the content is really interesting.
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"This course is absolutely fantastic. Lecture is always a treat, and this class is designed to be very low stress. I would suggest diving into the extra readings on Canvas if you have time, since they offer more of what the course does, which is environmental awareness."
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"I totally recommend this class as a science requirement. Weekly, there are in–class quizzes on Friday based on the lectures from that week and easy assignments were you read a research paper and answer basic questions, so, in my opinion, it's very manageable for McCormick standards. I would point out that the best part about this class are the discussions we have in class and the content in the lectures. I have never learned so much about various mechanisms and concepts related to Earth Science and climate change. I believe that every person should have at least some exposure to the course material in order to make more informed decisions. Overall, I would recommend this class to anyone who is even slightly interested."
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"I would hold back from saying this is an ""easy A"" class. Yes, you can and will likely get an A, but you have to put in the work, take good notes, watch the recordings, and study for the quizzes, since they may be tricky some times. It can get really exhausting to have a quiz every Friday of the quarter. However, this is easily one of the best classes I've taken at Northwestern. You'll really learn a lot of things about our planet that you probably have never even thought about or didn't consider that people are actually studying. Neal Blair is SO PASSIONATE about the content and really believes that us, the students, should know this to go out and do great things for our planet. He has faith in us, and I appreciate that a lot."
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"This class is a good, surface–level introduction to the interactions between humans and the environment (only the second half was really related to engineering). That said, I definitely found it necessary to study for the weekly assessments by rewatching the lectures."
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,"Prof. Blair is a very kind, very caring professor who cares a lot about his students and what he teaches. I enjoyed the structure of the course – instead of 2 midterms, the class has weekly quizzes on the relevant topic of the week. I felt that I learned a lot about the Earth's processes and was able to learn about how engineering can solve environmental problems."
mcmk,civ_env,203,spring,Neal Blair,5.41,5.39,5.21,4.14,5.37,3.79,Good class. Learn about climate–related topics from an engineering perspective.

However, Prof. Durango–Cohen is extremely helpful in office hours and that really helped me, so I'd highly recommend going to office hours to future students taking this course."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"Course was overall interesting. Class is very manageable, the professor is good but sometimes you will need to self teach yourself and read the textbook. Overall good and interesting class."

She offers a lot of office hours to ask questions about the homeworks (super useful!) and will always explain all your questions in detail. She is very patient and caring and wants to make sure her students are learning and doing well, but sometimes can spend a little too much of class time answering students questions, so the actual material can feel a little rushed sometimes. Although, she does regular check–in polls to check the pace of the material which is really nice. The two case studies are very ambiguous and TAs are extremely unhelpful with them."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"Overall, the class provides useful material and will help you learn more Excel, Prof E Durango Cohen is a good professor to take the class with"
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,This course was a good overview of finance and making decisions taking into account risk preferences. The professor is very helpful and wants everyone to succeed.
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,The course is a little tough to follow sometimes and the pacing is very fast. The midterm was also very difficult. The material is interesting though if you like finance.
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"Class was alright, material wasn't too hard but it was just confusing and the professor didn't do a very good job at organizing the material into a very comprehensive course. There was a lot of ambiguity when solving homework problems and a lot of the material tested wasn't covered very well during lectures."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,I thought this course wasn't super easy. In general I find econ unintuative but the professor was really nice and made the exprience better
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"The course overall is very good. I really enjoyed learning theories and concepts that can actually be applied into real life situations. Professor Cohen does a great job of explaining the content and doing examples in class, while also allowing us to use tools that are used in professional environments, such as Microsoft Excel. The homework assignments were always reasonable and based on class content, while sometimes also giving the opportunity to earn extra credit. The exams were fair and the case studies were fun to do, even though they required a little more work."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,Definitely take this class with elizabeth durango cohen and not the other professor. She explains things much more clearly and she definitely cares about her students –– she'll pause class often to make sure she isn't going through the material too quickly and always answers questions. Her office hours are the best if you need time to go over HW problems –– shes good at making sure you understand the problem and how it will be applied to exams.

mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"The professor and TAs (Cal and Tianxing) were generally a big help during their respective office hours. You could tell the professor was interested and invested in your learning, and she offered multiple opportunities to gain extra credit. The material could get a bit bulky but it’s not super difficult to understand. I also think the majority of the topics are applicable in real life (think credit card debt, loan management, etc) and it’s a big difference from some of my other classes. I would recommend you take this course as it’s honestly a really great chance for you to gain lots of applicable, practical knowledge."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,I liked the course in general because it was fun to experiment with functions on Excel. I also believe that it is important for me to know how to derive certain prices with given utility functions in real–life instances.
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"Rate: 6/10. Class is okay, material is basically split up into two different sets of material.

It also teaches you a lot of financial knowledge that you cannot learn in other McCormick classes. The class materials overall are not hard to learn but expect that the workload will be not that small. You will get weekly assignments, two case studies, one final, and one midterm."

It isn't the best class and one thing I found annoying was it was challenging to catch up if you didn't go to class or review even if you did. The professor is super kind though and really cares.
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"The course definitely teaches you important ""money"" related concept that is pretty important for you. However, the lecture slides are a bit lacking at times and even if she says she will post annotated lectures, she often times forgets to do so."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,This course was generally interesting and fair. The exams were on the longer side but extra credit opportunities were helpful. The only part I did not enjoy were the labs because there were several assumptions that needed to be made that were difficult to arrive at without talking to the TA and/or professor.
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"Professor Cohen is great. While I struggled to follow her lectures on the theoretical topics of this course–this in part due to poor lecture slides, she was great at going through examples in class through the majority of the course. Prof. Cohen really stands out though for the effort she puts in to ensuring the learning of her more enthusiastic students. In office hours she will walk you through full homework problems from start through finish. Attending office hours is probably where you will learn most in this course. The content of this course up to the first exam is very interesting. It looks at decision making and financial investment analysis in the realms of business and personal assets. Afterwards however the course tries to explore too many topics that are covered too briefly and too poorly ranging from probability and utility functions to securities analysis. By the time you get to the exam you don’t understand any of the topics well enough to do well without attending a serious number of office hours to do the 4 practice problems provided."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"As much as I didn't like the class, I really feel that I learned a lot. Getting familiar with Excel, cash flow analysis, and portfolio theory was definitely helpful. Unfortunately, there were some aspects of the class that I didn't like: the case study grading, difficulty of the midterm, and the fact that the practice exam solutions weren't posted."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"25% HW, 25% Case studies, 25% Midterm, 25% Final. Overall, the class should have been much easier than it was. Prof. Durango–Cohen definitely makes an effort to teach us the content necessary, but the pacing of the class with her use of PollEverywhere stops the flow of the class, and it actually is more distracting. I believe it is much better to just point at a student to answer the problems she puts in the slides. With homeworks, they are straightforward after office hours with the professor only, as the TAs don't explain their methodologies well. For example, the homework solutions would show the work to solve the problem, but there is no context in explaining what methodology is used. The exams are fair game, though it can be frustrating in how there can be many different ways to solve a problem. I believe the later part of the course can be taught better, with examples that did not require the use of Excel, as the final was an in–paper exam. Overall, this class teaches a lot of applicable skills, though its execution can definitely better, along with the resources like the textbook used."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"The professor is amazing!! She understands well the class material, and she explains everything perfectly. The course was quite hard for me however especially towards the end since I did not understand well how what I learned in class could be applied to problems given to us."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"If you spend time understanding the homeworks you should be okay. Make sure to attend the lectures because they are useful, especially after the first midterm."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"This course is a mess. There are two case studies that are given with the WORST instructions. Our group spent so much time asking the TAs and teacher clarifying questions because it just made no sense. They are also stupidly strict on the case study. Also, the TAs and professor do not post practice midterm solutions. This makes no sense. How am I supposed to know if what I am doing is correct? You can only get the answers by spending hours at office hours, which is such a waste of time the day before the midterm. One student took a photo of the answer key (the day before the test), and the TA snapped at the student. Why is it such a big deal that we take a photo of the PRACTICE midterm solutions. What's the worst that can happen? ""Oh no! The students know the answers to a practice midterm!"" Are they serious? They say its to promote studying because or else we will just look at the solutions. This is fundamentally wrong because 1. they do not know how we study best, and it's unfair to just force their method of studying onto us. We studied all our life to get into this school, so we have our trusted methods of studying. I study best from looking at the solutions, so let me do what I know best. 2. I ended up doing the wrong thing on the exam because I thought it was correct. I had no way of knowing it was wrong! It's really just such a waste of time. ALL IN ALL: the course requires maybe 3 hours of studying a week in order to get an A. It isn't hard, but it's boring and unorganized which makes wanting to study for it the biggest challenge. The professor is nice and cares about students, but that doesn't make me like the course any better."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"I felt like the material covered in this class as well as the homework assignments were very helpful for my learning. I really liked how the instructor was willing to let us use Excel. However, the Case Studies had extreme ambiguity that made it hard to know what to do. I wish that the Case Studies were a little more clear so the focus would be on applying skills not parsing the text. While the instructor was always wiling to help/answer questions, the TAs often refused to provide guidance which was frustrating. Additionally, the midterm exam felt unfair. The first midterm was simply too long, making it more of a race for time than a test of skills. I thought there was a good adjustment made to the final, which was a very appropriate test. Also, the grading was pretty harsh on the case study and partial credit on exams, but I have heard the class will be curved, which would be great. Overall, solid class that could benefit from shorter tests and clearer guidelines on cases."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,Good introduction to financial planning and the use of relevant Excel functions. Course is not too challenging and the professor is very dedicated to seeing her students learn.
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,I think the course was well–taught. The Professor goes a little fast at times but you can always ask her to repeat concepts. Midterm was tricky but very manageable.
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"Professor very helpful in office hours. She makes a very confusing topic more clear. Very applicable class to life, organized clearly."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,Good class. Start homework and case studies early. Be careful on those case studies to make sure you do it the way that the TAs want.
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,TAKE THIS CLASS WITH LIZ! She usually does a great job of explaining the concepts clearly. We had Pablo as a sub for us one day and his teaching style was totally different and not as helpful.
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,This is the worst class I have taken at Northwestern. The pofessor is a good person but just the worst professor on the planet. Expectations are not clear so you don't really know what to do.
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"This course is exactly what you expect it to be. Professor Cohen is extremely nice and wants her students to learn as much as possible. She makes herself available for questions and is happy to re–explain to you any topics you might have missed. However, what I didn't love about the class is that I often felt unprepared for some homework/exam questions. There were times where what was covered in class/what appeared in the book wasn't enough to answer certain Pset questions. Without attending office hours, which could potentially not align with your schedule, you felt you weren't given enough information to successfully complete some questions from the Pset. It would have been better if homework questions were directly reflective of the material covered in the lecture slides. Additionally, before the exam we are only given one practice test with no solutions and I don't feel that this was enough. Additional questions would have helped."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,I learned a lot about real world Econ regarding engineering and I feel as though I will utilize what I learned in class in the real world.
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,"This class has a decent workload, but it isn't too bad. There's weekly homework that doesn't take too long, and there's a lot of opportunities for extra credit. Make sure to pay attention cause it's really easy to fall behind on material. The final was only on stuff covered in the second half of the quarter, but the last couple lectures go really fast."
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,Unnecessarily hard– better organized course content and lectures are needed.
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,This course is manageable – I would advise taking advantage of the extra credit homework opportunities during the beginning of the course these are a great way to score extra points because the exams are quite tough and not a lot of time is given.
mcmk,civ_env,205,fall,Elizabeth Durango-Cohen,4.35,4.15,4.55,4.44,4.32,6.62,Pretty fast paced which isn't a huge problem because the concepts aren't too difficult. Some of the topics though were a bit rough and not much more time is spent going over them.
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,Difficult course with rapid fire learning requirements. But the curve is generous so as long as you score above average you will do very well.
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,Good basic engineering class to get through. The curve is super generous somehow and if you're a true engineer this should be a freebie for you. The stuff isn't super useful and you can cheese most of it if you learned how to use excel. Remember to do the exams at a good pace.
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"The professor really cares about you and he really tries hard to make the class interesting. Even though it's a boring subject and the classes are not too engaging, it was overall a good class"
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"No panopto recordings and the way he runs his lectures make it very hard for students to review the lecture. He relies very heavily on blackboard, and all the presentation files he posts on canvas provide very little background knowledge and information. Pretty challenging course"
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"This course provided a comprehensive introduction to the intersections of economics, finance, and engineering, specifically in the realm of environmentally focused engineering systems. The course content was well–structured and coherently presented, blending the basic concepts of economics and finance with their applications in modern engineering projects. Given my interest in financial engineering, I found the course content to be highly relevant, and my experience in the course can be organized into 5 different parts: 1. Recognizing Complex Consequences: This course did an excellent job of instilling in us a thorough understanding of the economic, environmental, and social implications of large–scale engineering projects. The trade–offs and consequences were examined in–depth, and real–world scenarios were used to illustrate these complexities. 2. Building Financial Literacy: The course effectively prepared us to engage in financially informed discussions and make sound financial decisions in our professional and personal lives. The integration of financial knowledge into the engineering context was particularly interesting. 3. Developing Proficiency in Commercial Software: This aspect was one of the highlights of the course. Learning to use Excel for techniques such as Present Worth Analysis was a great practical application that brought financial engineering to life. This not only made the coursework more engaging but also allowed us to experience how these techniques are applied in the real world. 4. Preparation for Advanced Courses: After completing this course, I feel well–prepared for higher–level courses in systems engineering, financial engineering, and managerial accounting. The foundational knowledge and skills this course provided are definitely solid groundwork for advanced studies. 5. Interactive Group Case Studies: The inclusion of two required group case studies was a major plus point. These case studies were intellectually stimulating and gave us an opportunity to apply the theories, techniques, and perspectives we had learned throughout the course. Working collaboratively on these projects was both entertaining and enriching, as it encouraged us to problem–solve and think critically while deepening our understanding of the material. Overall, CIV_ENV 205–0 has been a well–rounded and enlightening course. It effectively combined theoretical knowledge with practical skills, offering a unique perspective on the integration of economics, finance, and environmental engineering. The course was thought–provoking, stimulating, and invaluable to my growth as an Engineering student."
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"The class is definitely tough and our midterm average was a 52%, but I feel like I am learning quite a lot in this course. I didn't know anything about finance before coming to this class and now I feel like I have a good amount of knowledge coming out of it. Prof. Durango–Cohen is nice and very approachable if you have questions about the content, your grade, etc."
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,I really enjoyed taking this course and the content was very interesting.
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"I enjoyed the course overall. Professor can be a little confusing at times, but the textbook is very helpful and the homeworks are very fair. The exams are hard though, average for the first one was in the low 50s, but he seems to curve and he gives a lot of extra credit throughout the course."
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"Pablo is a great teacher. You have to go to all the lectures and take in depth notes, but as long as you keep up, you'll do well. Hard midterms, but curved generously."
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"I enjoyed working on the case study, but success on these assignments are very group dependent."
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,I learned a lot from this class since it was the first finance class I've taken. The homework is really important for helping you understand the material. The exams have pretty low averages but they're curved so you don't need to answer every question completely to get an A. The case studies are alright if you have a group that works together.
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"The content might not be exciting or interesting at times, but I think its important to know. Manageable workload, but case studies can be difficult and vague, and don't be surprised if the class average fails the first exam."
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"Pretty good class, homeworks and projects and overall content are easy but the exams are very hard."
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"This class mainly was divided into two parts, with the first one on cash flow and the second one on uncertainty. I definitely felt like the the first half was more applicable and expected from a ""finance for engineers"" class, but the second half felt like it could be taught in any probability or statistics type class. The homework load was manageable but you would need to show up to class since the professor didn't record lectures and the notes posted are basically skeleton notes of what is taught in class. The case studies were mainly busy work with an emphasis on formatting correctly, but weren't too bad overall."
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"Professor Durango–Cohen is clearly passionate about the subject matter and helping students learn the material. Attending class is a must, both for his help answering questions and because most of the notes and examples from lectures are not posted to canvas. The case studies are interesting, but time consuming assignments and it is important to have a reliable group as they are a lot of work."
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"This course is relatively straightforward. The first half is spent doing introductory econ– time value of money, inflation etc. The second half is about utility functions and probability. The case studies (2 of them) are relatively straightforward but definitely start early with your group and the homeworks and exams are doable. Try to be an active participant in class – it will help you enormously."
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"This course was not that difficult but you really should attend every lecture. The textbook is a little chaotic, but if you go to lecture then you'll be good. 7 total homeworks with 2 drops was nice, and make sure to try and do the extra credit during the presentations."
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"To me, this was not a good class. It was required for my major, and ultimately not that difficult (the work was not hard, and was generously graded). The first exam and first case study were both pretty difficult, but the second half of the class is easier. (The first exam had an average in the low 50s, but that all gets curved away anyway.) The tests are open note/internet/excel, and the case studies aren't as bad as they are often made out to be. Prof. Durango–Cohen is super nice and learns the names of all the students who regularly speak/show up to class. He is so kind and friendly if you go to his office hours, and I recommend you do if you have any questions at all. The TA's were really helpful and friendly as well (especially Cal). Seeing how much Prof. Durango–Cohen cares and how nice he is almost makes me feel bad to have disliked the class, but it is what it is. My main issue with the class is the lectures. Lecture always left me confused and turning to my friends with questions (that they couldn't answer either). Quickly I learned that reading the book is the only way to make it through the class; the book never took too long to read and covered everything from class, but was easier to understand."
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"There is weekly homework which is not too bad, 2 case studies, a midterm, and a final. The class material is very different before and after the midterm. If you don't have a background in accounting/finance stuff in Excel, the first midterm will be very difficult. The average for my class was 50%. The second half of the class is all about probability and will be much easier."
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"If you're new to excel it is a bit brutal and will take time on the learning curve. First exam is super brutal, and the teacher talks really fast in class so lectures are hard to follow."

mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,This was a required course for me but I was excited to take it going into it. The course is very demanding and it is easy to fall behind. The homework serve as a good indicator of what you should know but they are at times difficult to complete. There are two case studies that provide an interesting opportunity to apply knowledge taught in class.
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"I really enjoyed this course. I took it as a technical elective because I am interested in finance and business. It taught me how to figure out the best financial choices in a systematic, mathematical way, which is a skill I will definitely use. Professor Durango–Cohen is also super nice!"
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"Very good course if you're going into finance. Prof teaches basic fundamentals that are super useful to know.

mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"This course overall was fine. The reading/homework took up more time than you would expect, but they weren't incredibly difficult. Office hours are super helpful if you have any questions. The overall presentation of material was fine, but there aren't many notes posted online so it's difficult to understand what's happening in class if you don't show up. Pablo definitely cares about all the students."
mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,Not too bad. Pablo is a great guy and an alright teacher. However he is fair in terms of grading. Midterms are very difficult for no reason but the class gets heavily curved anyways so only matters whether you do above average or not. Do the homework and read the text book. 2 out of 7 HW gets dropped.

mcmk,civ_env,205,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.11,4.02,4.39,4.49,4.00,6.92,"The first midterm was pretty challenging. Homeworks are pretty fair for the most part and directly relate to class material. The midterm was unfair honestly. If you pay attention in class and go to office hours you will succeed in this class. Curve is very generous as well. Two course projects per quarter with a group. Start early; the first one takes a while. Good class to learn excel financial functions, cash flows, and portfolio evaluations (slight probability emphasis)."

He's super understanding and flexible with deadlines and such. He extended homework deadlines all the time and gives the opportunity to ask him questions about the homework in class. He's also super receptive to feedback. Our first midterm was too long and after seeing that people didn't do well he made the second midterm insanely easy and short. The average on the second midterm was a 96. Marrero has a clear understanding of the material and is good at explaining things multiple ways. He also learned the material in spanish and did a really good job teaching in english. He sometimes has a hard time with grammar but the language barrier is really minimal and you can always understand what he is trying to say. The class content is not hard if you pay attention in class. Marrero doesn't post his notes but if you have a legit reason to miss class you can email him and ask for the recording and he'll send it. Marrero was a pretty good professor for our class and I think he will only get better as he continues teaching. The class itself is structured really well and the content all ties together at the end. The content is just more EA2 so if you liked EA2 definitely take this class. O'Neill runs the bme discussions for this class and he's a fantastic professor. His lectures are interesting and he's really funny. Overall, I highly recommend taking this class with these professors."
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,"ALL MY HOMIES LOVE RAUL!!!!!!! This prof made this class great. He's so enthusiastic and genuinely cares about the well–being and academic performance of his students. Given that he was new to teaching this quarter, there was definitely a little shakiness at the beginning of the course resulting in a MT 1 average in the C–range, but he was able to recognise a disconnect in the class with certain concepts and offered similar questions on the Final Exam with a chance to improve and average the overall scores on those questions to increase our MT 1 average. I would say that the understanding of the concepts in this class also increased drastically by MT 2, where the average was close to 100%!! Raul will extend deadlines so far if his students even seem a little stressed and is so helpful in office hours. He really wants us all to succeed. If any tiny change could be suggested, it would be to either post class notes to Canvas or record lectures, as this class meets almost every day, so if attendance isn't possible sometimes it's hard if you don't know anyone in the class to ask for notes. That said, if you ask prof to send you the notes, he will. I can't speak for the computer labs (only for CIV section), but for BME kids it's a pretty decent trade to take class on Thursdays with Prof. O'Neill learning interesting stuff instead of doing 3 computer labs."
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,"This class was fantastic. If you're on the fence, I highly recommend it. The teaching style was super effective and the homeworks are straight forward."
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,Good class. Prof. Marrero's notes are clear and helpful to understanding all problems that come up in the class. Tests are sometimes fast paced but all questions asked are fair and can be adequately prepared for.
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,"I took the BME_271 section. The lectures are combined with CIV_216 so everything you do for homework and exams is Civil applications to the topics learned. The class was straightforward and well organized. The topics are not super challenging it is mainly just learning procedures for specific types of problems. Very similar to EA2. The exams were exactly like the practice exams and very similar to the homework. The time commitment is very reasonable for the topic. The BME lectures were my favorite part, they are very interesting and apply the class to BME topics. You also learn a fair amount about the human body materials and anatomy which was fun. You only have 2 paper reading assignments for the discussion which take more time to read than to write your response (1 paragraph) so they are very manageable."
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,"I really enjoyed Professor Marrero Rosa's teaching. The pacing of this course was spectacular. I learned a lot with the organized, intentional lectures and the homework was both relevant, challenging, and based on the material we learned that week. Office hours were accessible and helpful."
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,"I really enjoyed this class. This was Raul's first quarter teaching and despite that, he did a wonderful job. I'll admit there were certain topics that could have been clearer but Raul was super aware of our understanding and made an effort to go back through confusing parts again when he sensed the class was lost. Outside of class, the professor was very accommodating with pushing back labs and hw which was quite helpful. I'd say a key part of my understanding with this course was going to TA office hours so I encourage anyone who is taking this class to make use of those."
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,Not a lot of material stretched out over a long period of time.
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,Pleasantly surprised by this class. It is a much better version of EA2. It is a combo of statics and mat sci. THE TESTS ARE A BIG TIME CRUNCH SO MOVE FAST.
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,This course is basically just further in–depth EA2. I thought the exams and homework were very fair.
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,Professor Marrero is a really cool guy and as long as you keep up with what you are learning as you are learning it this class should go smoothly.
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,"I thought this class was pretty good. I enjoyed it more than EA 2. The material is not challenging but there can be some tedious work. Just make sure you are good at free–body diagrams. Professor Marrero was very nice. He really wants everyone to succeed. His lectures were clear and helpful although he sometimes was unable to provide intuitive explanations for certain concepts. Not a big deal though, this class is just about problem–solving anyways."
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,"This course is a great, fundamental class for anybody who wants to build something that doesn't break. Being such a fundamental class, it would be great if NU was able to dedicate great professors who could really teach it in an inspiring way; as it stands, what you get out of this class will be nothing more than you put into it. Keep the big picture in mind as you go from topic to topic. Prof. Marrero Rosa is a nice, funny guy but needs a lot more experience teaching."
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,"This class was not too bad. The content is a little confusing at times especially at the beginning. Professor Marrero is the absolute sweetest! He does a really good job explaining content and going slow, and lenient on extensions for homework. He genuinely care. The labs are super doable. Sometimes the homework are a little long, but its once a week so not bad at all. The tests aren't bad at all either. They aren't easy, but if you study and understand the homework you will be fine. I would say this class is very manageable."
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,"This class covers a lot of material. It is not an easy class, however, I much rather preferred taking this class as opposed to other engineering classes to fulfill a basic engineering requirement. If you enjoy physics, you will like this course. It helps going to office hours and studying the material in groups. Professor Marrero was not a great first–time professor at first, but he got better at explaining concepts as the quarter progressed."
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,"I found the course to not be too difficult, the exams are relatively straight forward and the homework assignments too."
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,Only the first few parts were relevant to my major even though it was required for MSE majors. It was an interesting class though.
mcmk,civ_env,216,fall,Raul Marrero,4.88,4.60,4.98,4.71,4.40,8.17,This course was very good. Instruction and expectations were very clear. The work was manageable. Prof. Marrero is very nice and cares about his students. There are many opportunities to get help outside of class too.
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,"Pathirage is an amazing, amazing, amazing, prof, lectures are clear and he manages to explain complex concepts in a way that makes sense. Midterms and homeworks are fair, similar structure to EA classes."
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,"I think that this class was generally fine in that the topics were fairly similar to EA2 and that typically you found yourself applying the same concept in different ways. However, I do feel as though there wasn't a substantial amount of information in to help you in the instance that you missed a class and needed to catch up."
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,"Madura was a wonderful teacher and presented the course material very clearly. There are two midterms and a final, not that hard to do well in if you study and do the homework. Note that the homework is ~40% of the grade"
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,"The prof was a great lecturer and really nice, he seemed to want us to get good grades and offered bonus homeworks etc."
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,"Prof. Pathirage is an incredible lecturer. He is engaging, clear, and excellent at answering questions and working through difficult concepts. I found this class enjoyable and applicable and thought that the work load and difficulty were reasonable."
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,Not too hard to get an A if you understand the material
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,"This class was the BEST class I took at Northwestern, and it is all thanks to Professor Madura Pathirage. He is extremely knowledgable about his field and you can see the enthusiasm in his eyes. I have talked to a lot of upper classmates, where all of them said this class was hell with other professors. I very highly suggest taking this course with Prof. Pathirage. The exams are all fair, the final was the hardest. The first midterm was a time crunch, but after seeing that everyone struggled the prof reduced the number of questions for the second midterm. The content is also very interesting and intuitive."
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,"Not too bad of a class, most problems and ideas taken from the textbook, where there are many resources online to help if the lectures/OH aren't enough. Just do the homework and you'll be fine on the exams"
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,This course was pretty good. The weekly homework assignments would take a while to do and to make sure were done right. I would've wanted more practice problems/tests for exams though.
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,"This course was relatively fair, 2 of the exams were hard and 1 was easy. The homeworks took like 3–5 hours for me, and for the BME discussion section we only had to read 3 papers that took like a half hour each. Madura is a good lecturer, I understood the content very well because of him the tests were just hard a lot of the time."
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,CE216 is great. Very much the same style as EA2 where you learn a formula and sign convention and are expected to apply it. Not too heavy of a workload and you walk out with lots of intuition when it comes to structures. Don't skip this class even if you can get by not showing up. It's worth your time.
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,"The Professor explains the material very clearly. However, it's quite difficult to do well on the exams given time constraints. You need to know every detail like the back of your hand if you want to score an A on these, which requires quite a lot of studying to do. Do not take this course unless you are actually studying Civ E"
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,Pathirage explained concepts really well. Only thing was there were no notes online or recorded lectures and the textbook didn’t really help much so either go to class or have a friend with notes. And sometimes the hw problems were a lot hard than the ones in class but office hours and the textbook should help.
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,"This course was fairly interesting. Some concepts were better than others. Overall, it was not difficult, but relatively tedious. I would have liked if the course involved a little more real–life application. Overall, the teacher is a good lecturer, and if you put in the work in understanding homework and projects, you will learn."
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,Praha ridge is awesome! He is receptive and his lectures are very well organized. He tells you exactly what you need to know on each exam. His exams were very fair
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,Pretty much EA2 and Mat–Sci 201 combined. Not too hard. Exams are mostly memorizing formulas.
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,"The class is very procedural. You don't really need to be smart, just know the steps to solve the problem."
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,"This class is required for most people who take it, but if you get the chance to take it with Madura I would totally recommend it! Good balance of derivations and practice problems in class, interesting material (in my opinion), and great instruction."
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,"Lab projects were easy for the most part, Homework was manageable (I'd recommend starting them early though). And the exams were tough, but it's a tough class no matter what."
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,The material of this class was pretty tough but it is very well taught and a fair course. I really enjoyed Madura's lectures and I found all of the homeworks and exams to be very fair.
mcmk,civ_env,216,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.35,5.04,5.11,4.65,5.00,7.15,Prof Pathirage is amazing. I would advise that you attend the lecture because he is a blackboard and chalk kinda guy but it'll be worth it. He simplified the material so well that it did not seem difficult at all. It felt like he was teaching simple physics. This is coming from a CS major who has no business taking this class; this is a great basic engineering class to take.
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"This class was fairly straightforward, which is good considering how important the topics are. Professor Alarcon made the lectures fairly easy to understand, though maybe with a bit too much theory, and she always answered any questions and cleared up any confusion. The exams are not easy but simple, and nothing unsurprising appears on them."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"I enjoyed this Class. Professor Alarcon was great and did a great job instructing. The class felt so rushed but that was not the professor's fault at all, there is just so much information and content that needs to be crammed into this one class. I wish I could have had more time to fully grasp all the information. That being said, I learned so much."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Prof. Alarcon is super nice and approachable and very knowledgeable on the content. I didn't really love how lectures weren't super mathy and were more her just explaining things generally and why equations are applied in certain instances when this is very much a course where you need to do math and solve a ton of problems in order to do well just like in EA 2. Still interesting though. Class isn't super hard but the average in the class right now is like an ~80 and I don't think there's a curve and I think the average is somewhat low because the homework (10% of grade) isn't easy and the exams (2 midterms @ 20% each and 1 final @ 35%) always have at least one question that is kind of hard so even if you know basically everything you can still make a few small mathematical errors and end up with a B like me and most others. Also there are 3 MATLAB projects @ 5% each and they are hard as #$#% if you don't have much coding experience like me and/or YOU WERE NEVER TOLD THAT YOU CAN JUST DOWNLOAD AN EQUATION SOLVING SOFTWARE ON MATLAB <–– This caused me serious pain and suffering, get that!"
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"There's a lot of self–teaching cause we didn't really do much in class. Class most consisted of Professor Alarcon going over topics that weren't really useful or relavant, while she avoided answering student's questions. Be prepared for that."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Great class with Alacron!! She cares so much about every student and makes an effort to learn everyone's name. She wants all to succeed. There are weekly homeworks, three labs, and 3 exams. The labs are all in the first 6 weeks of class, so the start of the quarter is very time consuming, but it gets a lot better. She provides excellent resources and is always happy to help."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,Professor Alarcon is amazing and everyone should take a class with her. She cares about her students and is passionate about the material she teaches. She is also very fair and encouraged for students to ask questions. It is not the easiest course but the homework are very similar to the tests and you can do good with a lot of practice problems.
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"I found this class interesting, and I learned a lot. However, it is hard and will take time to grasp the concepts and become comfortable doing the problems. It was pretty fast–paced in the beginning, but it gets better after the initial topic. I would really recommend reading Prof. Alarcon's pdf notes for each topic as she teaches them, because they help a lot with understanding the concepts and doing the homeworks. Prof Alarcon is really nice and she really wants to help students understand the class. Her office hours are really helpful too!"
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"This class has weekly homeworks (start then early bc they can be time consuming!), 2 midterms, and a final. As a BME student, I really enjoyed the BME discussion section, because we learnt about various facets of biomechanics and BME applications of the lecture content. The discussion is fairly low stress (3 small writing assignments); it's focused more on exposing us to various aspects of biomechanics."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Overall, I thought this course was pretty interesting and I liked the material that was taught. The exams were also fair. The only thing I didn’t like was how particular Alarcon was when it came to the homework, but generally, I didn’t mind the class and I feel like I learned a lot from it."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,This course was definitely a lot of work given the 3 computer labs and 2 midterms. The class also required significant time outside of class to support lecture material and further learn concepts on our own.
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"I enjoyed this course. Challenging, but Alarcon is a great teacher and very easy to talk to. Lots of resources available"
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"I really enjoyed this course and Professor Alarcon's teaching style. I put in a lot of effort outside of class and I honestly think this is very necessary for success. I was a little frustrated with the final exam because I feel like a for few of questions, although they were related to the concepts we reviewed in class, they were presented in a completely new manner and therefore made it confusing to try to understand what we were being asked. Also, (and I know this is out of the professor's control) for about 45min during our 2 hour final, there was a band practicing very loudly in the room next door to our exam room, which made it very difficult to concentrate and truly be able to show all that we knew on the exam. I guess overall my reaction is that it is a good class but very frustrating at some points in time."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"If you took EA2 with Professor Alarcón, you already know that she is amazing, and you should also take 216 with her! The class covers a lot of material but it all ends up coming together nicely and fairly intuitive. Homework and labs take up more time at the beginning of the quarter so the course is actually front loaded. Exams are fair and similar to homework problems, additionally, you learn some cool real world applications throughout the class."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Taught relatively well, but had inconsistent pacing throughout."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"PLEASE TAKE THIS WITH ALARCON. She genuinely cares about each student and makes this class so interesting with her enthusiasm. I did not like EA2 so I expected to not like this, but the class was so interesting and I loved going to class. There is weekly homework but it is not bad at all and it is good to help review. Exams are very fair, if you can do the homework then you will ace it. Just please take it with Alarcon."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"This was one of my favorite courses this year. Prof. Alarcon is a great professor who has a lot of experience in structural engineering. She explains topics well and in a way that is engaging, and its clear that she cares about the progress of her students. The course pretty much picks up from EA2 and the content throughout the course isn't very difficult. The homework questions are all questions from previous tests and reflective of what's on the exams. If you do the homework, chances are you'll be fine in the exams. My only complaint with this course is the labs. There are 3 MATLAB labs that are similar to the labs in EA2 that were very time consuming to complete while teaching me nothing. It's not hard to get a good grade on the labs but I don't think they supplemented the course at all."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Overall a fair and balanced course. The assignments and labs may take a bit of time but there are PLENTY of office hours and once you do them and understand, youll be almost ready for the exam. The course defo takes some time but the more practice you do is the more it pays off unlike some other courses. Prof Alarcon is really nice as well and a great resource for Civils. Just attend class, do(and actually undertand) homeworks and go to office hours and you'll be good."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"I took this class to fulfil a requirement for my mechanical engineering degree. I thought it was very useful – ME 240/315 hit on several of the same topics – and I found it reasonably enjoyable. Professor Alarcon is fantastic and engaging. Her office hours are well worth your time, even if it's just to chat about the fun facts she posts on the Canvas page. Go to class and pay attention! She'll know your name and call on you. Tests were very fair, homework was just past test questions."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,This class is good and helpful. Professor Alarcon is good but she does write really long exams. Even when I practiced a lot I had to rush through the exams.
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,The material of this course is pretty interesting and not super difficult since its very systematic. The most annoying thing is that there is no equation sheet and by the final there's like 30 equations to have memorized. Alarcon likes to say you don't need to memorize anything but obviously that is not true. The exams are fine though so it isn't too painful of a class.
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"When I first signed up for the course, i was worried about taking it as a freshman since its normally a sophomore class. however, it is totally doable and it is actually somewhat helpful to take it right after EA2 for the reaction forces. Alacron was a great prof to take it with!"
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Professor Alarcon is such a character. This class is a little unfocused, though, and sometimes you'll wonder where the lecture came from, and she tends to jump around from topic to topic a lot. Although her explanations are good and she gives lots of resources to learn. This class will make you feel like a real engineer and help you to describe the world around you a bit better."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Alarcon does her best to go through a lot of content in such a short time. The recourses available are plentiful, but if it doesn't come easy to you then it will take work. Study, make sure you understand the homework well, go to office hours and you got it."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Pretty good. It's fine if you go to class. Notes are posted, so those are nice, but it's better to have professor explanation"
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Overall, I think this was a good course! Learned lots and the professor is GREAT! Professor Alarcon is really lively, fun, and invested in the information that she teaches. She offers lots of help outside of class and is really set on connecting with students too! Just make sure to keep up in class or you WILL get lost and, unless you put in the work outside of class, it is difficult to catch up."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Alarcon does a great job at teaching this course. Go to office hours, the TAs and Scholars help a lot along with Alarcon"
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"This class was pretty good. I wasn't super interested in the subject material but I was always engaged and interested in class because of Professor Alacron. If you put in time to learn how to solve the problems, then you will do reasonably well."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Basic engineering class – kind of like a follow up to EA 2. No recorded lectures or extensions given by this professor though even under unusual circumstances, but lots of office hours. Otherwise a really nice professor who enjoys her topic."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"This was a time consuming but useful class to take. I learned a ton, and while the exams were a time crunch, they were also fair. My advice is to keep up with the content consistently throughout the quarter, because there’s a lot to learn."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"This is a very fair class. The content is a little slow, but this is also a very reasonable pace that lets you actually learn, digest, and internalize the content instead of just whizzing by. The tests and homework are surprisingly fair for a mccormick class, and there's really no hidden surprises. However, there are also a decent amount of complaints about Alarcon; although I think she cares, she is strict to the point of heavy concern. I had a medical issue and missed school for a week, and asked for a single day extension on a lab due that was 5% of my grade. I was told my options were to either skip it or drop the class. One of my friends told me that when they took this class, she failed multiple people simply for not putting down their tests when the clock hit 0. A friend with ADHD voiced concerns over how this matter was dealt with too. Basically, very fair class, but if any issue or unforeseen circumstance occurs, there is nothing you can do, and you will be told that it is your problem to deal with. It really doesn't sound like a big deal, but I have heard (and had) so many complaints about it that it is something to be considered."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"216 with Fleming was fine. Her exams are fair and the TAs this quarter were good. My main gripe about this class is the labs and the HWs. It's the exact same format as EA2 and like I understand why they're there but the 2nd lab was just a pain to do and was not fun. The HW format is another thing. The HWs themselves were fine, but Fleming seemingly has absolutely no issue giving 0s out on HWs because if a student doesn't follow the format exactly 100% to a T. I feel like it was just one of the graders having a mix of a power trip about grading and being lazy and not wanting to grade the HWs and so they gave 0s for HWs that were ""too messy"" (if you had a problem on the same page even if you separated them with a line and highlighted the new question number) which is stupid. When I brought my concerns to Fleming she seemed like she did not care one bit, which just did wonders for my mental health. There is a balance between wanting students to be ready for a job and just straight–up demoralizing students who do the work for multiple hours a week yet, and Fleming apparently has no issue giving students multiple 0s on HWs because they're not perfect. Anyways, the course itself is fine and Fleming is a good lecturer and know what she is talking about, but if you have a concern, good luck. I have genuinely never seen a professor snub off a student's concern like Fleming did and be unresponsive to emails."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Alarcon is the best engineering professor I have had at Northwestern so far. Her class is not easy, but she is a great teacher and covers the material well. Not only that but she is very accessible and friendly outside of class."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Alacron was the best prof I have ever had. She is so understanding, kind, funny, and smart. She makes it her goal to learn everyone's names (in a 100–person class) and genuinely cares about her students. She is an amazing teacher. Take this class with her!"
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,Alarcon is great at teaching this class. She has a strong background in the subject matter and always showed us projects she has been involved in wherever we were discussing the topics. If you didn't love/find EA 2 interesting then this class isn't for you.
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Alarcon is indisputably an amazing teacher. she is clear, passionate, and fair. I have no interest in CivE but it was one of the more enjoyable required classes."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,it was an okay class... i think it's somewhat ridiculous that we had to buy a whole new calculator for this class (which is apparently a recent policy) – i know the professor is trying to prepare the students for the FE exam but also consider a large portion of the class is taking this class as a basic engineering...
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Prof. Alarcon is a great teacher. Other than no recorded lectures, no picture taking, no use of calculators higher than TI–36X Pro, the class was fine. Must attend every class though. Lab's do take a while, but they're just like the EA2 Labs. All the homework is past midterms so those were helpful. I enjoyed the class, the topics were cool. Civ 216 with Prof. Alarcon is a pretty fair class. That's how I'd describe it, not impossible, just fair. It's clear that Prof. Alarcon has been doing this for a lot of years, she know what she is doing, take her advice."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Professor Alarcon is a fine teacher, but i found the exams to be quite challenging. She can be very strict at times but she teaches the class well. Very similar if you had her for EA2, but the course content is much more challenging."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,eh.
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"This is a great course to get acquainted with the basics of civil engineering – Alarcon is a great professor, and despite the fact that the material can get a bit conceptual, it’s very helpful for understanding future concepts in engineering."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"CIV 216 goes to show that mastering the fundamentals is by far the most important task on a student's plate; we often forget this because we quickly get dragged into trying to avoid question 'traps' without investing enough in our foundational understanding. Put another way, we tend to practice in ways that prepare us for exams by making everything 'familiar' rather than intuitively approachable. This extends to all aspects of learning of course."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"This course is a natural extension to EA2, and the course content is very informative and reasonably challenging. After taking this class, I am confident in answering mechanic–engineering–related interview questions. If you are an engineering major analyzing on material structures, this class is a must–have."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"The homework was surprisingly kind of difficult in class, and Alarcon doesn't post notes for each lecture, only one long pdf of all examples. She was also a stickler of not taking pictures of the blackboard in class for some reason. Overall, the course wasn't bad, but it wasn't really that interesting to me. It felt like applying a bunch of formulas, and she doesn't allow a cheat sheet either."
mcmk,civ_env,216,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.21,4.85,5.31,5.02,5.10,8.77,"Alarcon is such a nice lady, don't get me wrong. But I do not like her teaching style. She ONLY uses chalk boards and writes arrows all over the board. It's very confusing and hard to follow. Also, her overall teaching style is to start with the big picture and work her way down to the small stuff. However, you can't understand the big picture because you haven't learning the fundamentals yet! This means half of her lectures don't make sense until 5 lectures later when she explains the fundamentals. At that point, you have to relearn everything from the previous lectures. She's super nice in office hours! Lectures are bad. On a separate note, MATLAB projects take a loooooooong time. Homework also takes a long time. This class is a big time commitment. Overall, you learn a lot!"
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,"Honestly, this class disappointed me. The professor just stands at the front of the class and reads directly from his computer every single class. It's a waste of time going to class. It is all very disorganized. Then, he gives you an exam that you are completely unprepared for. He doesn't give you any practice questions so you really just go in blind and hope that you remember everything he has talked about in class. For being such a bad professor, I was SHOCKED at how harsh of a grader he is. Even though this is an easy class, do not expect an easy A. The professor was a nice guy, but he needs to learn how to actually teach. The homework assignments felt completely irrelevant to what we had learned in class. I felt like I was setup for failure."
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,"This class is almost just an architecture history class. This class was the first class Professor Aronson taught. He felt unprepared and often did not explain assignments well. He graded very subjectively and many assignments did not have a rubric. Take this class if it interests you or if you need it as a major requirement, but I would stay away otherwise."
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,"The topic of the course is interesting but the course itself isn't very interesting. The lectures are 80min each (sometimes shorter) and the prof. just reads off of a slideshow that is uploaded on Canvas anyway, which gets boring. A large portion of the midterm is memorization of different structures, which I don't see the value of, but it can be done by reviewing slideshows. The final project is a 10–20 pg essay done with a group, when it really should just be another 5 pg essay done individually instead. There is very little math in this course and if you've taken EA2 or you know what a moment is then you'll be fine. Having taken the course, I look at structures differently and am more interested in structural design, so I don't regret taking the course at all."
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,"Structural art is a nice break from the more math heavy engineering classes, as the course is mostly about the philosophy of structural art and how is relates to various buildings. Don't expect a super easy class though –– there is still a fair amount of homework and the final project is fairly large."
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,I think this course was pretty okay. The HWs were not too hard and lectures often ended early. There is a lot thrown at you in this course –– a good chunk of the one midterm was memorization. So if that's not your thing then don't take this. Overall this was a pretty chill course. The professor was fine and understanding.
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,"I had high expectations for this class as all my civil and environmental engineering upperclassmen friends praised this course and said how enjoyable this course was but my experience was pretty subpar. The class was still relatively easy but the lectures were not that engaging which made the class not that enjoyable. The instructor was new so I did give him some benefit of doubt but overall, this class just felt like another class I had to take for my major and not the engaging class I thought it would be."
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,The actual content of the class is interesting but the delivery is not all that engaging. Everything talked about in class was highly conceptual but some of the homework was based completely on technical math that wasn't taught in class. It seems that the professor just kept the assignments from the last professor and didn't change them
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,The reading was thoroughly enjoyable.
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,The material in the course is interesting but the new professor was not engaging so the class was very hard to get through. The hw isn't too bad and the final project isn't too bad either if you can work with friends.
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,"i was really looking forward to this class initially, but it honestly fell short of my expectations. the lectures were pretty dry and i felt like the homeworks relied a lot on your previous experience in different engineering classes rather than the class content that was being taught. aronson gave good advice but he was sometimes rather blunt. i could tell he put a lot of effort into the class but i still felt like it was just not as interactive as i was hoping."
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,Do not take this class if not required. I took this class because I read good ctecs about this class so I was taking it for my GTE. The class material was boring and the professor was very bad at engaging the students. The midterm required us to memorize the years a specific building or bridge was built.
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,"The understanding of forces and moments felt glossed over and I didn't understand the overall purpose of the class most of the time. Was it EA2? Was it a history class? Was it something in between? The homework was unexpected every time because of this. The test was mostly memorization, which I am not great at, so even though I paid attention and found the content interesting enough, my grade wasn't great."
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,"The content was interesting and I walk away with a greater knowledge of a subject I am interested in. I just wish the homework and test felt like they had a purpose I believed in, if that makes sense. It was definitely more work than I was expecting and try to take the class with friends."
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,"I took structural art for my major (civil engineering) and if it is not required I don't recommend taking the course. The content was pretty interesting but the lectures did not have the best delivery and homework was often busy work. However, this class does not take that much effort and should be an easy A if you try at all."
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,"This course made me very annoyed throughout the quarter. The slides that Professor Aronson presented were on average 80 pages long, and he read exactly from the speaker notes. His cadence was too fast to efficiently take notes, so I would then need to go back through after class and take notes from his speaker notes, because there were never any words on his slides. That was, if he ever published his slides on time."
mcmk,civ_env,220,spring,Michael Aronson,3.40,4.04,4.42,3.16,3.44,4.38,"Additionally, the homework would have engineering problems that required math and critical thinking and problem solving. This was expected and encouraged, because this class is in the civil and environmental ENGINEERING department. What was not great was that the single midterm was then a memorization history–like test. I wish it had matched up better to the homework and lectures. Nothing seemed to be continuous."
mcmk,civ_env,221,fall,Madura Pathirage,5.69,5.60,5.63,5.50,5.38,7.26,Excellent course with a great instructor.
mcmk,civ_env,221,fall,Madura Pathirage,5.69,5.60,5.63,5.50,5.38,7.26,"In the first few weeks, the course reviewed (and slightly expanded upon) the information learned in Mechanics of Materials (CIV_ENV 216). The rest of the class introduced new material that was reinforced by the homework and fairly tested on during exams."
mcmk,civ_env,221,fall,Madura Pathirage,5.69,5.60,5.63,5.50,5.38,7.26,"Prof Pathirage is great – the course content is pretty tough but doable, and exams aren't overly stressful because he gives you a clear idea of what to expect from them. The homework can take a really long time, but it's all relevant material and Pathirage is nice about giving extensions. So, overall a difficult but straightfoward course – the material taught in class is what will be in the homework is what will be on the exams. In the beginning of the quarter, figuring out SAP2000 was sorta rough because the class didn't have a TA or spend that much time teaching it – I think having recorded SAP2000 tutorials, or providing recommendations for existing tutorials, would be helpful to future classes."
mcmk,civ_env,221,fall,Madura Pathirage,5.69,5.60,5.63,5.50,5.38,7.26,"No cap, this class was hard. It definitely took some heavy studying to do well. But if you keep up with the homeworks, you should be good fr. The prof was a cool guy and a great professor. Probably one of the best that i've had at NU. But overall its not really an enjoyable class since the material is so dense"
mcmk,civ_env,221,fall,Madura Pathirage,5.69,5.60,5.63,5.50,5.38,7.26,I really enjoyed this class! The class was really small and very interactive. Emphasis on understanding the material instead of grades was much appreciated. 10/10 would take again!
mcmk,civ_env,221,fall,Madura Pathirage,5.69,5.60,5.63,5.50,5.38,7.26,"This class can be a lot of work at times, but Prof. Pathirage does a great job at walking you through examples and problems in general. He is also very receptive to problems that students have and is willing to work with your schedules to lighten your time burdens. This class is one of the first classes I took here where I really felt like what I was doing was real civil engineering."
mcmk,civ_env,221,fall,Madura Pathirage,5.69,5.60,5.63,5.50,5.38,7.26,This class is very well structured. The professor is great at listening to what students need in order to understand the concept. SAP2000 is not the worse to navigate after the first assignment. As long as your attending classes and keeping up with the homework the class isn't rough.
mcmk,civ_env,221,fall,Madura Pathirage,5.69,5.60,5.63,5.50,5.38,7.26,"This class is an extension to CIV 216, and if you like that class, you'll like this class too. Professor Pathirage is a great instructor who wants to make sure you know exactly what is happening and why. Exams were extremely fair, and I felt like they represented what was taught in class well. My only complaint was that sometimes homework problems got a little convoluted, but I'd take difficult homework problems that I have a week to deliberate and ruminate on over hard exam questions any day."
mcmk,civ_env,221,fall,Madura Pathirage,5.69,5.60,5.63,5.50,5.38,7.26,"As a student who went into this class not doing the best in EA2 and CivE 216, I was worried, as this class is essentially a continuation of those last two courses. If you also felt this way though, don't worry anymore. After this class I am more confident than I had ever been in myself and being able to do these types of problems. Professor Pathirage is hands down the best professor I have ever had in my experience at Northwestern so far. He does relevant examples, actually explains theory in tandem with the examples, and is just a great guy. Also, homeworks and exams are extremely reasonable, so don't worry too much about that. Make sure to attend class though, as he doesn't record lectures (even though the 9am time slot was brutal some mornings, it's so worth it to attend class everyday). Highly recommend this class and having Professor Pathirage, he's the best!"
mcmk,civ_env,221,fall,Madura Pathirage,5.69,5.60,5.63,5.50,5.38,7.26,"This was the best course I have taken at NU. Pathirage is my now favorite professor ever. When I tell you he did not take attendance but I still never missed one 9AM lecture. He explains things sooooo well and systematically and is so flexible with students not understanding or needing extensions. He literally would do hw problems with us in class if we were struggling to complete the assignment. I learned and understood more in this class than I ever have and genuinely liked the subject matter and problems. Go to class, pay attention, take good notes, ask questions and never miss the class before an exam because he will tell you exactly what the three questions will be."

Lectures were pretty boring though but as long as you keep up with the homework, practical sessions, and labs you should be fine! He throws a lot of other information on slides that stresses everyone out before exams but really those three things are the most important and he doesn't try to trick you on tests with things you didn't really dedicate time to in class. Midterm is multiple choice and final is only 2 questions (one theoretical and one practical). Both were a lot of studying and memorization."

mcmk,civ_env,250,fall,Alessandro Rotta Loria,5.33,5.07,5.19,5.13,5.13,6.01,"This class is perfectly reasonable with its expectations, but it is very dry. For the most part, nothing was ever too challenging (homework or exams), but I also tended to struggle to stay focused during lecture. I think part of this is the massive amount of information in the slide decks, only about 20–30% of which is directly pertinent to exam and homework material. So much information comes at you quickly, and most of it just passes by, making it difficult to parse out what is important and what is supplementary. Overall, the class is good. Rotta Loria is always personable, happy to answer questions, and is very accommodating, its just not a subject that personally resonates with me."

The format of 2 lectures followed by a practical session where you learn applications is not as good as doing examples and problems as you are learning the material. There isn't a ton of outside work to do, but it can feel a bit tedious to do, especially due to the format requirements of the assignments. Overall it is a fine class."
mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,"Professor Wells was very helpful and understanding when I had problems throughout the quarter.

mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,Pretty good course! Wells is a great prof. Not too difficult either.
mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,"Not very difficult, but also not very interesting. Professor Wells is nice though."
mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,"Even if the content of this class was not the most interesting to me, I did enjoy this class. The atmosphere of the class was so fun because the class was a pretty cohesive group and Professor Wells is so nice and helpful. The guest lectures enhanced the class as well. The lab reports did not always have the most clear expectations, however."
mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,Wells is a great professor and he teaches 260 well. The workload is manageable and the tests were fair. Also open book and notes so
mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,"I think Professor Wells did a great job at giving an introduction/overview of the field of environmental engineering, with a focus on water, since that's what most Northwestern's environmental engineering research centers around. It did sometimes feel that the equations we were applying were a bit arbitrary, but I understand that was mostly because we didn't have the time to derive everything. The labs were a really well set–up opportunity for us to apply the content, and the homework assignments are very representative of the open–note exams. For the exams, I would highly recommend reviewing the problems done in lecture, on homeworks, and in the textbook, since the exam problems are largely quantitative and therefore similar."
mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,260 was a great course and Wells is a great teacher. A wide variety of content is covered related to environmental engineering and its application to civil engineering. It covers a variety of topics from chemistry to history to engineering and is a great course.
mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,"This is a very solid introductory course to the environmental engineering field. All coursework was very doable, we were able to use notes and formulas on exams, and labs were straightforward. Lab reports took longer than expected, but Prof. Wells and the TA were extremely accessible and helpful for all conceptual questions. Prof Wells is very passionate about the subject matter and genuinely cares about the success of his students– this was very refreshing to see and made it so much more engaging!"
mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,"This course helped me learn a variety of environmental engineering–related equations and, more importantly, how they are applied to solve problems. Many textbook, homework, and exam problems followed the same format, making it fairly easy to decide which equations to use to solve the problems. While class time focused on environmental concepts and a few practice problems, homeworks were the most helpful for preparing for exams and figuring out how to use different equations. My best advice is to study for the exams by reviewing each homework problem and understanding what equations to use to solve it, if applicable. The labs were fairly structured and took more time out of class than the homeworks because all the data had to be organized, interpreted, and presented in a formal report that was 3–4 pages long, though there were only 3 labs throughout the course. The supplemental guest lectures and readings/discussions were interesting and mainly counted toward participation in terms of grading. Prof. Wells showed that he cared about every student and always contextualized the equations we were learning."
mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,"Interesting course that covers a lot of environmental engineering. May not be the most interesting to civil majors but Professor Wells is such an awesome professor and caring person that the course is enjoyable! Both exams are very fair and similar to homework, only the first lab is a little tedious."
mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,The course was engaging and Professor Wells is a great professor.
mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,"This was a very fair course and Prof. Wells is very helpful and understanding. Though some of the math wasn't very interesting to me, it is understandable and can be fairly straightforward if you pay attention. Labs were pretty fun to do imo and exams were reasonable."
mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,"I really enjoyed this class. Professor Wells is very passionate about the subject and does a great job of teaching the course. I wasn’t necessarily interested or knowledgeable about environmental systems before taking the class, but I feel like I learned a lot and have a great base of knowledge on environmental issues."
mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,"This class offers an excellent answer to the question of ""why environmental engineering"" and an excellent overview of the answer to ""how environmental engineering"". I only wish we had more time to dive into more specific topics that the class introduces, but I suppose that is the point of the course – it offers an overview and then other courses can scratch the itches that this class causes."
mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,"This class was great. Wells is one of the best STEM professors I've had here, really takes the time to explain applications and why its important to know each concept. One problem set a week, three labs, and two exams. Thought it was a very interesting class and well taught."
mcmk,civ_env,260,spring,George Wells,5.80,5.12,5.24,4.72,5.44,5.40,"Professor Wells was great. He was always very helpful in office hours and willing to work with you via email if you had any questions. If you put in some work and make an effort to study the material, this class is fun and not stressful."

mcmk,civ_env,301,winter,Kimberly Gray,4.39,4.85,4.85,3.26,4.33,3.00,Good course overall to help direct your career path.
mcmk,civ_env,301,winter,Kimberly Gray,4.39,4.85,4.85,3.26,4.33,3.00,It was nice to see all the different careers withing engineering that I could pursue. I enjoyed asking the speakers questions and learning more about their profession. Great course to do some career searching.
mcmk,civ_env,301,winter,Kimberly Gray,4.39,4.85,4.85,3.26,4.33,3.00,The guest speakers themselves are interesting
mcmk,civ_env,301,winter,Kimberly Gray,4.39,4.85,4.85,3.26,4.33,3.00,Interesting class that gives you an insight into possible careers. Not much work outside of class which is nice.
mcmk,civ_env,301,winter,Kimberly Gray,4.39,4.85,4.85,3.26,4.33,3.00,"In a technical aspect this course isn't that important, but I think it was great to get a good idea of personal development as a Civil Engineering major, and I appreciated getting to hear from so many different qualified speakers. However, some of the speakers are a lot more boring than others so it's frustrating when you have to sit through some of the less engaging presentations, but overall I think that was like 3 of the 10?"
mcmk,civ_env,301,winter,Kimberly Gray,4.39,4.85,4.85,3.26,4.33,3.00,Overall good seminars so worth attending. Very little work overall
mcmk,civ_env,301,winter,Kimberly Gray,4.39,4.85,4.85,3.26,4.33,3.00,Seminars were interesting and showed different avenues of work we can go into with CEE degrees

mcmk,civ_env,301,winter,Madura Pathirage,5.75,4.67,3.83,3.40,5.50,3.00,Pretty chill course. Profs give a nice overview of the topics you will need to study for the FE.
mcmk,civ_env,302,spring,Patrick Croke,6.00,6.00,6.00,5.25,6.00,3.00,"This class is awesome. If you're an engineer and have any sort of interest in legal related concepts, definitely take this course. Professor Croke is super charismatic, funny, chill, and knowledgeable. He brings in many guest lecturers as well who are tailored to more specific topics which was also very helpful to get the fullest understanding of the topics that are covered in the class. This is a phenomenal class, and I highly recommend it to any and every type of engineer."
mcmk,civ_env,302,spring,Patrick Croke,6.00,6.00,6.00,5.25,6.00,3.00,I loved this course.
mcmk,civ_env,302,spring,Patrick Croke,6.00,6.00,6.00,5.25,6.00,3.00,"Take this class, you learn a lot and you have to try to not get an A"
mcmk,civ_env,302,spring,Patrick Croke,6.00,6.00,6.00,5.25,6.00,3.00,"Absolutely take this class, especially if you’re looking for a good technical elective. It is a very chill class, but you’ll also learn a ton! No homework, two very fair exams, and one presentation at the end of the quarter was all we had. Enjoy!"
mcmk,civ_env,302,spring,Patrick Croke,6.00,6.00,6.00,5.25,6.00,3.00,Great course! Interesting lectures and guest speakers and very few assignments
mcmk,civ_env,302,spring,Patrick Croke,6.00,6.00,6.00,5.25,6.00,3.00,Great course! You learn a lot more than just law that applies to engineers and it really helps to have a basis in all these different areas both in your professional and personal life. Professor Croke is extremely knowledgeable and a great instructor.
mcmk,civ_env,302,spring,Patrick Croke,6.00,6.00,6.00,5.25,6.00,3.00,This course was awesome! Def take it if you want to be able to keep up with conversations about legal and business stuff! Professor and all guest speakers were super engaging and cool – talked to us and treated us like adults which I liked. Also you are basically guaranteed an A with doing no work outside of going to class.
mcmk,civ_env,303,fall,Keith Harley,5.73,5.73,5.77,5.14,5.68,6.49,"The course was very informative, professor Keith Harley explained each law with good examples that made the class really interesting. The course work is well structured and easy to understand"

mcmk,civ_env,303,fall,Keith Harley,5.73,5.73,5.77,5.14,5.68,6.49,This class really gives you an understanding of how environmental law works in the US. It is not a huge workload and Prof. Harley is a pretty good communicator.
mcmk,civ_env,303,fall,Keith Harley,5.73,5.73,5.77,5.14,5.68,6.49,Highly engaging class! The professor teaches anecdotally in an interesting way that makes you passionate about the subject and able to remember and use the content later.
mcmk,civ_env,303,fall,Keith Harley,5.73,5.73,5.77,5.14,5.68,6.49,"I absolutely loved this class! Although it only met once a week, this course taught me so much about the history of major environmental laws and policies and how they are applied in real life. It was extremely low stress, and the lectures were incredibly engaging for a three hour class. Definitely take this course!!"
mcmk,civ_env,303,fall,Keith Harley,5.73,5.73,5.77,5.14,5.68,6.49,I know many environmental laws and have learned a lot from these laws and policies. I think this will broaden my horizons when solving some real–world problems in the future.
mcmk,civ_env,303,fall,Keith Harley,5.73,5.73,5.77,5.14,5.68,6.49,"The lectures are long, but if you are paying attention, the assignments are a breeze."
mcmk,civ_env,303,fall,Keith Harley,5.73,5.73,5.77,5.14,5.68,6.49,The lectures are important and useful to students.
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,"Definitely a hard class, but you will learn a lot. Make sure you always go to lecture and take in depth notes because most of what he teaches won't be on the posted slides."
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,"Content is important, professor is nice, case study is relatable"
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,"Durango–Cohen is a very caring and supportive professor, but his lectures were not the best way to learn the material. He mostly focused on doing examples without really introducing the concept or topics, so reading the textbook before every class is a must. The homeworks and case studies can be very time–consuming, so starting early is a must. He's also very generous with extra credit and curves the course."
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,"This class was great. Professor Durango–Cohen is a decent professor, most of his lectures are very tangible, and I haven't had to do much extra reading to learn outside of class. The weekly(ish) homeworks are very doable, and there are two case studies, each of which were not extremely difficult but very time consuming. The workload is not overbearing. There are two exams in this class, which are pretty fair in terms of difficulty and knowledge."
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,"I found this course to be tough for me. It involved a lot of economic/managerial skills that are helpful for engineers to know for their careers, without a doubt. I just don't personally find the material interesting, so I struggled quite a bit. Prof. Cohen is very fair and wants to see the class succeed, which is nice. His mind works too fast for people grasping the concepts for the first time. He'll go over some tough concepts relatively quickly and have an expectation that we'll be able to follow, but my peers and I struggled to do so"
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,"I have no real reaction to this course. The material did not catch my attention in any way, and I do not feel as if I grasped much of the material. The introduction to finance as an aspect of engineering was interesting, and a break from a schedule of design courses."
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,This is a good class! I took it as a basic engineering elective as I am not a CivEng student. The professor really cared about his students and was accommodating. The financial planning section is very applicable to everyday life even if you aren't majoring in CivE. At times the material can be a little dry but it is very manageable and useful content!
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,I thought it was a good class in terms of the topics covered and how useful they are for civil engineering however I will say Prof. Cohen goes pretty quickly through material and it is easy to fall behind so making sure to keep up is a necessity.
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,"This class was helpful, but I didn't really like it all that much. I don't care for Econ, but Professor Durango–Cohen tries his best to make it interesting, and he is certainly invested in every student's success. That being said, I don't know if anyone ever loves this class, but it's definitely not the worst required course for the Civil and Environmental program, and I appreciate the care put into the class."
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,Excel was surprisingly enjoyable in the earlier parts of the course; things got a little compressed at the end of the quarter.
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,"Useful course, very applicable to the real world. Stay on top of things and you should do fine in this course."
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,"These are important concepts that every engineer should know, and they were taught well."
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,"This course was one of its kind in all the engineering courses I have ever taken. I had no idea that engineers had to deal with financial decisions at such a deep level. Even though I enjoyed learning new concepts, I have to admit that they were, most of the time, hard to understand and required a lot of effort."
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,"Good professor, solid course. I enjoyed that it was more applied than other math/statistics courses I've taken and we did examples related to civil/environmental engineering."
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,"It was hard, I didn't have much experience with finances so I was pretty lost. Regardless I found the challenge to be rewarding."
mcmk,civ_env,304,spring,Pablo Luis Durango-Cohen,4.50,3.97,4.39,4.58,4.07,7.00,"This class is generally fine. The first half of the course is quite interesting and I understood it quite well, but the second half gets incredibly more complicated. I was very unprepared for the complex math involved in the optimization problems, and my lack of knowledge was not helped by the fact that solutions to the examples done in class were not given. If you weren't furiously writing down all the information in the example you can't go back and review the stuff you don't understand. Overall it is a fine class, and I did not think the work load was particularly bad."
mcmk,civ_env,306,fall,Ying Chen,4.37,4.15,4.33,4.48,4.33,5.77,"Overall, I wasn't crazy about this course. It had nothing to do with the professor or TA, they were great. The content itself was just unappealing to me."
,,,,,,,,,,,Support from professor and the concepts of statistics helped me better prepared for understanding and application of the theories.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Basic stats class, straight–forward material and instruction"
,,,,,,,,,,,"A lot of code provided by the professor, I enjoy reading codes and try coding myself"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Chen was so kind and understanding and always willing to help. However, the lectures in this class were very difficult to understand, and I ultimately had to teach myself a lot to be prepared for the exams and final project."
,,,,,,,,,,,Pretty straightforward probability/stats class. Professor Chen is a good professor and you can tell she wants her students to succeed. Assignments/exams are fair.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Chen is genuinely one of the nicest people in all of Northwestern. She truly cares about her students and makes the classroom experience as welcoming as possible. The first half of the class (up to the first midterm) may be more challenging without prior stats knowledge, but the assignments prepare you well for the exam. The second half of the class is where lectures are harder to follow since most of it seemed to be geared towards a graduate student level. However, the final project and exam are both very fair and you learn how to use Excel pretty well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is decent. Very doable if you've taken AP Stats, maybe not as much if you're really coming in with zero stats knowledge. The midterm is easy, the project gives you a lot of leeway, homeworks are worth a lot. If you need to knock out a major requirement but don't want something extremely difficult, this is the class. The professor is very nice but she speaks really softly and her slides go super fast, so you kind of have to be looking at the slides on your phone or computer while she lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was not my favorite class. Ying is a really nice professor and pretty helpful, but I did not really learn much throughout the course. The lecture slides were taken up by lots of really long formulas and there was a lot of information covered that I found we really did not need to know. I would have like to spend more time doing example problems with the concepts we were learning, which we did none of. Still, the work itself was not too bad especially if you have some background in stats knowledge."
,,,,,,,,,,,The professor was great but I would say this course was definitely more challenging and hard to follow for those that had never taken a stats class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course overall helped me learn introductory statistics, but if you don't already have a good foundation coming in, you'll struggle. The materials, such as the slides and the homework were the most helpful in my learning. Homeworks and finals were tough but manageable if you start early. Lectures were hard to follow though"
,,,,,,,,,,,I enjoyed the lectures. Sometimes they were fast but it always helped that (1)Dr Chen was happy to pause and respond to questions and (2)the slides were available to get back to after class. The assignments were the most helpful aspect of this class. Working on them outside class helped build my understanding and confidence.
mcmk,civ_env,308,spring,Keith Harley,5.63,5.56,5.67,5.56,5.89,7.50,The material is taught in a comprehensible manner. The workload is light and interesting. TONS of resources are provided for anyone who wants to do further research into any of the discussed topics.
,,,,,,,,,,,I really like the different aspects of the environmental justice professor given in class.
mcmk,civ_env,309,winter,Keith Harley,5.81,5.69,5.81,5.31,5.94,5.22,The lectures were really good in my opinion and you get to learn a lot about energy law and things you really wouldn't think about. There was a big assignment worth 60 percent of the grade but I think enough time is given and the professor is always available for questions and such so it's up to you to get it done on time. Many weeks there is a paper on an energy law topic... not too difficult imo and they're usually interesting and followed by a class discussion. I do wish we got a bit more feedback on assignments to gauge the professor's standard; as I'm writing this I have no idea what my final grade will look like but overall it was a solid course.
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a good course for someone looking to increase their knowledge about energy–related legislation.
,,,,,,,,,,,Very interesting class
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course was incredible. The lecture style was unique and offered an environment conducive to learning. The final paper could be written at any time during the quarter, which made the final flexible to our schedule. This helped me do a better job on the final and do it at my own pace. Overall, the structure is organized and at an appropriate pace. I've learned a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,Enjoy
,,,,,,,,,,,Lectures and weekly assignments were helpful for learning. A variety of interesting and relevant topics were covered.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I mean 3 hours on Friday does sound quite terrible, and I definitely didn't like the room, but professor Harley is an incredibly engaging speaker and the conversations we had were also very nice so I would recommend taking the class even if that 3 hours looks daunting because it's not that bad. Also, we never used all 3 of the hours anyway"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought this class was just going to be reading through and discussing a lot of legal jargon but it was more trying to understand the current state of the energy in America. Every week would be focused on a different topic, and typically the professor would talk about what that thing is, how companies can produce that thing, and what regulations are in place by different government agencies to limit/promote production of that thing. We would end on a class discussion of our reading responses for the week on that subject. The professor does a fantastic job of not only explaining everything but spinning a narrative in a way that really captured my interest, and I learned so much I did not know about this subject."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great course about how energy works in the US with Prof Harley. Weekly papers and a final research report.
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was dope. You are going to learn a lot about the energy sector. There were some readings but they weren't really required fr. We had a weekly essay to write about the previous lecture material but he grades kindly and they were not too much of a hassle. Prof always let class out early too which was clutch. Overall great course. 100% would recommend!
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is amazing!!! Worth even the Friday time. I learned so much every time that pushed me beyond my current beliefs. The papers before the class are more completion based and teach you so much. LOVED IT!
mcmk,civ_env,314,winter,Neal Blair,5.56,5.33,5.56,5.56,5.56,9.22,"The written homeworks were really difficult for this class, but I definitely have a better grasp of how to read and digest scientific journals now. Other than the written homework, there really isn't anything else you have to do for work in this class other than the final exam."
,,,,,,,,,,,Definitely do some chem review before taking the class if you have not done chem in a while.
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Blair is really kind and a great professor I will however say the course is pretty challenging and sometimes it was hard to understand the assignments.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good course for those interested in organics, less engaging if you aren't. Lectures cover a wide range of topics so can be a helpful overview for generating new research questions."
,,,,,,,,,,,Ask him questions during the class is the most important thing!!!
mcmk,civ_env,320,fall,Sinan Keten,5.00,4.67,4.67,4.67,4.67,7.00,Class was difficult but Keten explains the material well and the material directly pertains to real applications.
mcmk,civ_env,321,winter,Matthew D'Ambrosia,5.30,5.00,5.60,5.40,5.40,9.00,"Although this was a challenging class, I learned a ton. I knew very little about concrete going into this class but came out full of concrete knowledge. The labs were interesting and definitely teach useful skills for anyone interested in working with concrete in the future. My main struggle with this class was with the homework––there were a couple that I found very challenging. I felt I could have used more direction on some of the assignments. The lab reports, too, took a lot of time to complete. Get started on them early if possible."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course is well structured, and offers a very comprehensive analysis of the concrete design process."
,,,,,,,,,,,I think this is a very good course for any civil engineering student interested in structures. The topics are varied and applicable to industry and research. The assignments are very practical and include using software that I believe will be very useful for real projects. Dr. D'Ambrosia has a lot of knowledge in both research and industry and his lectures reflect that. Very good course.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a must take course for everyone who is interested in concrete, structural engineering, environmental sustainability, etc. The concepts are explained very well by the instructor. The concepts are then reinforced with labs which makes everything even more clearer."
,,,,,,,,,,,"While I did not do as well as I would have wished to do in this class, it will definitely go down as one of my favorites from my time at Northwestern, and this class honestly convinced me to want to pursue a PhD and want to do research with concrete. Professor D'Ambrosia is very, very knowledgeable, approachable, and willing to help. Class is pretty long, especially near the evening (2 hours) but he gives you a five minute break at the halfway point of the lecture. Meanwhile, labs were definitely my favorite part of the class, as we actually were able to conduct in–person experiments on the things we learned about in class! One of the only gripes I have about this class is that the exams can be pretty difficult when compared to what we do in the homework. Luckily though, exams are open note (albeit, only allowing you to bring hand–held/paper notes – you can't use your iPad/laptop). All in all, this was a phenomenal class, and Professor D'Ambrosia was a phenomenal professor. Highly recommend this class."
mcmk,civ_env,323,spring,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.83,5.67,5.90,5.55,5.73,9.00,"Professor Alarcon teaching a design class is always good, and I don't think I need to elaborate all that much. I don't know who is teaching Steel in the future, but if they follow her example, it should be great."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was pretty intuitive once you followed the lecture and notes. If you took concrete you already know the drill, there are some differences but you should be good to go. Otherwise you can pick it up easily as long as you took 216. Cool stuff"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Alarcon is a sweetheart! Class goes really fast though, hard to keep up if you can't look at her notes on canvas and teach it to yourself."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course was time–consuming, but the professor ensured we had enough practice questions to understand the material."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class, challenging but worth taking."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a little difficult, but nonetheless I enjoyed it a lot and would recommend it to rising juniors/seniors."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a great design class to take. Prof. Alarcon teaches it very well (as per usual) and I never felt like the content was too complex or out of my league to solve. I felt properly incentivized to go to class every day since the lectures were super helpful. The amount of work was also not crazy over the top, although there is a few hours per week spent on work outside of class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Using the steel manual as this is the material used by professionals.
mcmk,civ_env,325,winter,Arantzazu Alarcon-Fleming,5.92,5.79,5.62,5.15,5.77,7.56,"Professor Alarcon is a very engaging professor who really cared about each and every one of us and made her primary focus that we learned the material as opposed to rushing through specific topics. She also always put a focus on the ways these topics are used in the industry and the real world, not only teaching conceptual design, but also smart practices that should be applied in industry, and a better overall understanding of the way design works in the field. The first homework (while terribly long) was a great example of this, and although I'd never want to do it again, it is a useful skill to have gotten to develop."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Interesting class and taught well by Alarcon, very clear0cut lectures and notes"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was extremely well taught, in a concise and straightforward manner. The small class size fostered a closer relationship to the instructor which benefited all the students in the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,Alarcon is such a sweet and understanding professor. I really like how she treats us as adults and isn't trying to trick us or scare us. She really wants us all to do well and gives us the tools we need to be able to. The midterm was easy and very reflective of what we learned in class. Homeworks were sometimes time consuming but she was really helpful if you were confused. She has a deep understanding of concrete and it shows.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class bridges the gap between theoretical civil engineering and practical design engineering. There is a lot of thought that goes into rebar and concrete and it is interesting to learn why. I think most classes will start out with you confused about the process but it all makes sense by the end of the 50 minutes. If you are someone interested in structural, you can read about the empirical papers which contributed to the code, or you can take it as a design class to get through. In my opinion, this class is about being organized and understanding the process for design and analysis in bending, shear and serviceability. There is not a whole lot to memorize since you write your own cheat sheet for the exam, but it may be useless if you don't remember when to use which process or equation on your cheat sheet."
,,,,,,,,,,,I thoroughly enjoyed this course!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Alarcon is amazing. I am not a civil major, but I mainly took this class because she was teaching it, and it ended up being my favorite class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Learned a lot about concrete analysis and design.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Building off CIV 221 and CIV 216, this class takes everything you've learned before and applies it to a specific material. Professor Alarcon is very organized with the class, and, honestly, nothing is that new or different than what was done in previous courses. As long as you stay on top of the class, its straightforward and interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great class. Professor Alarcon's notes/teaching style will not only make homeworks very doable and fair, but also will make exams a better experience. Highly recommend this class for any civil engineer. Can't wait to take more classes with Professor Alarcon in the future!"
mcmk,civ_env,327,fall,Wing Liu,3.20,3.33,3.76,4.33,3.15,11.38,"CLass covers a lot of topics, which could have been explained better."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is very understandable, while those equivalent ones in many other universities are oftenly obscure."
,,,,,,,,,,,The ABAQUS lab sessions.
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a good class. It is much more math heavy than I expected and less time actually doing FEA then I expected. The lectures were very disjointed as there were like 4–5 different lecturers. There was also very little direction on the final project.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Instructor doesn't teach much, but the textbook is really helpful"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Difficult subject matter and not taught very clearly. You will need to read the textbook to understand what is going on, as lectures are often unclear or too quick to go over details. Learning to use the software is nice. Excessive amounts of homework."
,,,,,,,,,,,The instructor is a fun person. The in–class lectures were not very useful. You must learn by yourself by reading the book and watching online videos.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course did not focus on any aspect, very broken in organization"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I knew from the start that this class was primarily independent study. What I did not consider was the amount of homework and projects assigned. I took this class among other demanding courses and the time spent working on projects significantly reduced my study time. The exams are almost purely theory, which you have to learn independently, but the projects are more applied which means the time spent working on projects will not help much with the exams. The positive side of this course is that the instructor and TAs are generally very pro student and allowed deadline extensions which were very helpful in the week of midterms when every class had assignments or projects due. TAs hold office hours and are available to answer questions."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The professor does not show up to class, and the lectures are disorganized and not useful for learning the course material. If your goal is to learn FEM, it would be more useful to just read through a text book. The tutorials for the Abaqus program are also not useful, and online resources would be more helpful."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I struggled to learn in this course because the class was poorly lectured and poorly structured. The professor didn't show up to class half the time and instead had his TAs go step by step through theorem derivations or simulation set–up, both of which felt very slapdash and like the TAs didn't prepare at all for lectures. Even when the professor came in to lecture it felt very disorganized and like he just came in to talk about whatever he was thinking about on the day of. In homework, often we had to work problems without any relevant examples from lecture or in the textbook, so I felt like I was just shooting in the dark for a lot of questions. I felt that most exam questions were okay but when covering the midterm the TAs and professors all gave different answers for the same question. We received basically no guidance on our final project which was disappointing because I was hoping to learn about a subject that is super interesting to me, but I learned nothing."
mcmk,civ_env,330,fall,Jason Brown,5.57,5.43,5.43,4.29,5.43,4.72,"Jason was very helpful in explaining in great depth the different areas of project management and the homework assignments were not focused on being difficult, but instead helping us students apply the information taught in lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite the difficult time of this class (6:30–8:30 pm), overall it was a really good class! Jason did his best to keep it engaging and presented all the lectures in a way that felt very thoughtful about what would actually matter to know when working, and was a super helpful and great resource. I went into it not thinking I had any interest in the material but found it really helpful to learn something very tangible and real, like what actually happens when you start a project. I would recommend this class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Very straight–forward
,,,,,,,,,,,"More layed back course, a lot of practical and useful information is thrown out for you to learn. It's really up to you how much of this information take up."
mcmk,civ_env,332,spring,Scott Peterson,5.67,5.33,5.00,4.33,5.00,8.33,I thoroughly enjoyed this course.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great course, especially if you are considering a career in estimation or construction general. My only word of advice is to stay on top of things because all though the work is very manageable, it can start stacking up if you don't plan accordingly."
mcmk,civ_env,340,spring,Edwin Yesid Saavedra Cifuentes,4.88,4.60,4.90,4.56,4.11,7.00,"Edwin is a baller. Class required work and effort but it wasn't insane. First midterm was quite difficult and lengthy though, but second midterm was reasonable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think Edwin did a great job given that half the class was a bunch of graduating seniors who really did not want to be taking the class this quarter. The first half of the class felt like review since most of it was covered in ME 241. I found it harder to understand the second half of the class, partially because it was new material, but also because I felt like less example problems were done in class, and so on the homeworks we had to figure out everything ourselves. Especially for the midterm and final, I wish some kind of practice exam or at least some sample questions were given, other than 'go look at the problems in the textbook.'"
,,,,,,,,,,,Would highly recommend this course if you're interested in how water moves.
,,,,,,,,,,,Lectures and assignments were helpful for understanding the information.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was overall fine. It is difficult since it is basically advanced fluid mechanics applied to environmental systems, but I never thought it was overly harsh. I think that the amount of time spent outside of class was reasonable, and I think that the course is well paced. I also really liked how much python I learned in this class, I do believe that I can effectively use it in other applications now which is pretty cool."
mcmk,civ_env,346,winter,Aaron Packman,5.69,5.62,5.62,4.23,5.46,9.16,I really enjoyed this course!! It was so helpful and interesting to learn about all of the ecology and ecosystem dynamics of aquatic systems that we don't usually get to touch on in other classes.
,,,,,,,,,,,This is my favorite class I have ever taken. It was so great to see different green infrastructure ideas and the data behind them as well as the system prospective. It was so fun and combined biology and chemistry and engineering which is my favorite combination and professor packman is so interested in this topic and loves people asking him questions and coming up with new ideas. 10/10 great class
,,,,,,,,,,,Overall the projects so far are not very difficult. Only need to listen what prof and TA say during the class or discussion.
,,,,,,,,,,,It's amazing
,,,,,,,,,,,Lectures and guest lectures were interesting and covered a variety of topics. Overall an interesting and engaging course.
mcmk,civ_env,352,winter,Alessandro Rotta Loria,5.06,4.76,5.06,5.18,5.06,8.41,The course showed me basic concepts of the design of foundations and retaining walls.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Bi–weekly quizzes were rough, but completely manageable if you make sure to focus in class specifically on what he's saying because he'll tell you to which depth he expects you to know the material, which then informs how much you should study each topic. The homework reports are brutal though I'm not gonna lie, I felt physical weight lift off my shoulders once I finished the first homework, but it's definitely all feasible. Please work with your fellow classmates though, doing this class alone would be brutal."
,,,,,,,,,,,There was a lot of material taught relevant to the general understanding of foundations engineering.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was taught backwards, with 4 short quizzes and only 2 homework assignments (both assigned after Week 8) making up the majority of the grade. The class material was generally not taught in a manner that was easy to follow, and little to no examples were solved in class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"this course was def challenging but I totally recommend it. I learned so much about foundation structures and it was cool to apply what I learned to buildings I see in my daily life. There were only two hw assignments and 4 quizzes with no final. the material was dense at times but if you attend lecture and take good notes, you'll be fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Rotta Loria is an exceptional lecturer, a phenomenal professor, and is very understanding with pushing deadlines if students sometimes would have other large assignments/exams for other classes. The only things I would say were downsides to this class is the bi–weekly quizzes were very rough, and there weren't enough homework assignments to compensate to help us better learn the concepts by practicing. I much preferred the assessment format he utilized in Earth Surface Engineering (CEE 250), where it was one midterm, one final, and 5–6ish homework reports. Other than that though, if you're interested in either structural or geotechnical engineering, this is a class you should definitely take!"
,,,,,,,,,,,The class overall was fairly average. Most of your grade depends on 4 15 question multiple choice quizzes that can be fairly stressful/intimidating. You learn a lot but don't cover as much application as I would like. Prof. Loria is a fine lecturer but sometimes makes the material harder than it needs to really be.
mcmk,civ_env,357,spring,James Hambleton,5.86,5.50,5.13,4.63,6.00,5.50,The course content was very interesting and led the class to bright discussions.
,,,,,,,,,,,"In this class, the professor starts to teach the termamechanics in a very creative and interesting way, which can help students gain a basic understanding quickly. And the classes also related to elasticity. I enjoy this class a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not a rigorous class, but you certainly learn a lot from Professor Hambleton and your peers. I can't really tell you what you'll learn because it's always changing, but it's definitely a good class to see the breadth of applications of Geotechnical Engineering and other general Civil Engineering topics."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a great introduction to the idea and field of terramechanics. The course covered broad topics and relied on student engagement to bring forward interesting new topics and ideas. The course was highly conceptual and based around problem solving mindsets, and determining every possible variable involved with solving a problem, more than even solving problems themselves."
mcmk,civ_env,361,fall,Luisa Marcelino,4.84,4.68,5.11,4.94,4.79,10.80,"This class requires some dedication to get a good grade. Lectures can be difficult to follow at times and there are little materials besides the textbook to prepare for the exams. Case studies, student led–discussions on a real world microbio example, were fun to do and participate in though. The only con is the amount of material needed to read to prepare for each of these"
,,,,Luisa Marcelino,,,,,,,The course was very interesting but it was very dense.
,,,,Luisa Marcelino,,,,,,,"Hmmm I enjoyed lecture, but the case study projects did not seem as beneficial. Maybe if they were structure in a different way, it would benefit students more."
,,,,Luisa Marcelino,,,,,,,"The course was very interesting and informative, I enjoyed attending the lectures. The course work was very well structured and organised. The case studies helped make the classes more interactive."
,,,,Luisa Marcelino,,,,,,,"This is a great class! Lectures are very dense, and I highly recommend at least skimming the readings before lecture. The quizzes are challenging, but if you understand the material conceptually, you will be fine. It is not all memorization. This class is a lot more about application, especially with the case studies. Overall, if you embrace it, this course has a lot of really applicable material, and it is worth your time!"
,,,,Luisa Marcelino,,,,,,,A little difficult for people who are not biology majors to learn
,,,,Luisa Marcelino,,,,,,,"Solid class overall. The two–hour class could definitely drag on sometimes, but Prof Marcelino is very passionate about the subject. I thought the midterms were both fair (especially since extra credit was given for good explanations/extra examples). Case studies were interesting and definitely helped me learn the material better."
mcmk,civ_env,361,winter,Luisa Marcelino,5.20,5.11,5.10,4.90,5.50,8.30,Good class! Marcelino is cool and cares about the students and the course content.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I have very mixed feelings about this class. On the one hand, Professor Marcelino is extremely knowledgable and passionate about the subjects she is teaching. Her lectures are very engaging and she can answer any questions you may have. She's very energetic and you won't be bored. The topics of the lectures are very interesting and relevant, and I learned a lot from them. However, the class is quite chaotic. Assignments and due dates are never quite clear, lectures are rushed because there is not enough time to finish them, and in–class presentations are interrupted and rushed as well. The class can definitely be structures better to enhance the learning of the students."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The case studies focussing of flu and SARS viruses, human microbiome and wastewater surveillance were interactive and interesting. The final paper assignments were helpful in learning and getting an in–depth understanding about the SARS Cov–2 virus, the Covid 19 disease, the diagnostic tests available ,its impact on the immune system and how the pandemic occurred."
,,,,,,,,,,,It was a great way to see different health issues and microorganisms involvement in them.. It was cool to see the public health side and how they interact with each other and the consequences of that as well as some history. It did become a bit too much COVID by the end and I have more topics I wanted to cover or cover more of but overall great class to take especially if you have an interest in anything health/biology related
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, a very informative and interesting course. Case studies and assignments presented information on a variety of different topics. More opportunities for in class discussion of course material would have been helpful."
,,,,,,,,,,,Case study!!! answer questions for case studies!!!
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot from this class then I imagined I would, especially since the main assignments are just 3 case studies and a final paper. The final paper is worked on throughout the quarter through drafts we submit, but it helps cramming everything till the last minute."
mcmk,civ_env,364,winter,George Wells,6.00,5.71,5.71,5.27,5.57,4.72,This class is very well done. I was never really stressed out during the course of the class and I did learn a lot about how water systems work. Highly recommend taking this course.
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class with a great professor! Exams and homeworks were very fair and material seems applicable to future work.
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was a great class. I learned a lot about policy, water system design, new sustainable technologies and environmental policy and Professor Wells was a great instructor. He is also one of the most understanding professors I've ever had."
mcmk,civ_env,367,fall,Jean-Francois Gaillard,5.13,4.75,5.12,5.65,5.25,13.20,The course was informative. The coursework was very well structured and organised.
,,,,,,,,,,,The homework and TA sessions were vital to connecting the concepts and examples
,,,,,,,,,,,challenging homework that can take hours
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was not as bad as I was expecting. The material can be challenging but JF is a good lecturer and the homeworks/midterm were representative of what we learned in class. The homework sets could be time–consuming so definitely start them early. Overall, points of this class will definitely be time–consuming and hard but it's mostly manageable and you learn a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,It's really hard to use jupter
,,,,,,,,,,,This is an interesting course that will challenge you. You get into it what you put out and make sure to start the homework early. Overall a good class.
mcmk,civ_env,368,fall,Kimberly Gray,5.50,5.27,5.36,4.91,5.53,8.69,"Lots of information, lots of reading. Lectures are kind of unstructured, covering a smattering of relevant topics. I ended with a better idea of what sustainability entails, but with only a few specific details."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great course on, essentially, sustainable urban design. However, it’s not heavy on architecture. The course details all the various engineering methods and principles required to transform any city into one that’s more in–tune with natural cycles and is adaptive and resilient to climate change. Dr. Gray is amazing and genuinely cares about the topic and the educational growth of students. If you are interested in environment and sustainability, this course is a must!"
,,,,,,,,,,,I learned a lot from the weekly reading that I hadn't learned before
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course has a lot of interesting concepts and a group project. It would be nice if the class wasn't a straight 3 hours. However, it is tough to get full grades on assignments when the instructions aren't clear and when grading policy is not clarified. Make sure to participate in front of a huge class of people. It is also extremely obvious who the professor likes and will openly interact with. If you aren't in this group of favorites, expect lower grades and lower participation."
,,,,,,,,,,,Interesting course if you're interested in sustainability. It covers a wide range of topics and really opens up your eyes to the complexity of the problem and provides you with resources to dig further on your own. I think I would have liked to be able to apply the knowledge learned in a more practical way. The group project attempted to do so but felt too surface level.
,,,,,,,,,,,The lectures are important and useful to students.
,,,,,,,,,,,Lectures and reading material were helpful and covered a variety of topics.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class, since it’s discussion based it was very interesting hearing different points of views"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Interesting subjects but little time to really go in depth. Prof Gray is a good lecturer though and I enjoyed the current events and news snippets we talked about. Weekly papers were very manageable, but the group project absolutely drained my soul; 8 people in a group is too many and lends itself to many slackers."
,,,,,,,,,,,Highly recommend this course for anyone interested in sustainable design and how engineering can change the course of climate change. I learned so many valuable things. The 3hr classes were long sometimes but professor Gray does a great job keeping the class engaging. Make sure to set aside time for the final group project!
,,,,,,,,,,,"The energy of the teacher helped energize the class and I looked forward to it every week. Especially the ""in the news"" section"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course structure involves a great deal of weekly reading with straightforward position papers with broad prompts. The broad prompts enabled creativity and flexibility in what topics to discuss that were relevant to the week's readings. 3–hour lectures were rough, but there were adequate breaks built in with plenty of opportunity for open class discussion; these last two points kept the class engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is super interesting, but it is also way more work than I thought it would be. The weekly assignments are very informative and manageable. However, the group project requires a lot of time. It is really important to stay on top of the project starting week 3, and be sure to start communicating internal deadlines with your group from the beginning."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a very fun and interesting course. Make sure to do the readings at a good pace so you are ready for lecture, being able to discuss in class with Prof. Gray is very fun. Definitely start the project early and front load it if possible!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked this class–– Prof. Gray's energy and enthusiasm through the full three hour lecture is really impressive and I particularly appreciate her efforts to connect to and remember the names/backgrounds of all of her students even though it's a really large section. Also appreciated is having a final project instead of something more conventional like a paper or exam. While the really large groups can be daunting to organize and pull together, the final project really helps in applying the materials learned in the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,The readings were incredibly interesting and I learned a lot of sustainability initiatives and the broad context of research.
,,,,,,,,,,,It is such a good course to learn about sustainability in a broad manner. I really enjoyed the course and the professor.
mcmk,civ_env,370,spring,Erica Hartmann,5.46,5.08,4.86,4.86,5.46,8.99,"I liked this course! I rated it a bit low on ""how much I learned"" because I took a similar class previously at a different university and we definitely went over more content that I feel was important in that course. However, this class has a good workload, is excellent for teaching you some soft skills like presenting and literature review, engages you with the material through the final project, is pretty flexible regarding the requirements for the final project, and gives you the knowledge you need to have really interesting conversations in the real–world about this subject matter."
,,,,,,,,,,,The coursework and classes were engaging. The course was interesting and the format of the class helped me to understand the concepts better and apply them.
,,,,,,,,,,,"During the course, we practiced our presentation skills and learned about various aspects of contaminant and calculation!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Reading by myself for homework assignments is most important to me.
,,,,,,,,,,,IT is a slightly unconventional class but because of that we could eb and flow with the classes interest and ask questions we wanted to. It was a cool vibe and never too stressful and it allowed me to be more creative than I had been in a while which is a big thing for an engineering class. I enjoyed it. This class never really stressed me out and I learned some interesting thing (and strengthened my distrust of large companies).
mcmk,civ_env,371,fall,Joseph Schofer,5.21,4.78,4.59,4.30,5.04,4.38,"this class is incredibly boring. 2 hour lectures are far too long and just so dry. exam was super hard. assignments are few and far between which is nice and don't take too long. if you're interested in the subject you can probably get something out of the lectures, but as someone who really didn't care for the topic, the classes were actually painful."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There is a lot of information, and mostly qualitative, in class. Surely it has been a challenge to me, who is a more quantitative person. However, it has improved my skills to think of implications of a technology on society and how to express my ideas concisedly."
,,,,,,,,,,,"major req. Heard it was easy but not very much. easy homework, not super easy exams. if you are interested in transportation, take it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Two hours is definitely too long for a class session. Although I did like the content, at times I felt that the professor tended to go on a tangent and I found it hard to identify where we were in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I feel like this course gives a great look at transportation planning with a quite manageable workload. One constructive feedback I can provide is about course material, though. I don't think there was enough material to study and feel comfortable as there weren't any practice exams or study resources other than in–class slides (which could've been designed better and made more clear). Also, the class wasn't recorded and this wasn't as I had to miss some classes due to other responsibilities. However, even though you feel underprepared on occasions, I felt mostly comfortable during exams, but some curveballs were definitely there."
,,,,,,,,,,,The lectures were very good. The Professor knows the material so well and has brilliant examples for almost every concept he brings up.
,,,,,,,,,,,"While the slides can be very comprehensive, he always highlighted the most important things to focus on and this made revision so much more effective."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The assignments were great to apply the concepts in class, and the Friday discussions helped us to delve much deeper into some case–studies of topics we were covering in a more general sense in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class lecture is way too long. Prof is super nice and caring, but the rambling nature of the class is a bit boring. Exams are also not an easy A –– very low averages and pure memorization."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Decent course. Fair assignments, fair workload, fair exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Schofer is very engaging and knowledgeable, and the course gives a nice overview of a lot of topics in transportation. Would highly recommend if you have an interest at all in transportation"
,,,,,,,,,,,Course was nice
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall I did not enjoy this course very much, and it had absolutely nothing to do with the professor or the TA because they were both great. The content was just unappealing to me."
,,,,,,,,,,,Solid course.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Schofer is an expert in the subject, and is very passionate about it. Unfortunately he rambles on a little bit during every class, but luckily he annotates his slide decks to further convey the most important things you should take away from the lectures. Homeworks are reasonable as well, and so are the exams, just make sure to really study them and know key terms. Overall, while this subject isn't exactly my cup of tea as a civil engineer, Professor Schofer's class is an interesting and good class to take!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a great course to get a crash course overview of transportation planning. It's fairly low stress and was a class I really enjoyed going to each week.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Classes were very dry and all lecturing, pretty tough to pay attention."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Relatively stress–free class to learn about many elements of transportation planning and analysis. Heavy focus on concepts in the lectures, while homeworks and exams are heavily focused on formulas."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great class to take if you're interested in transportation. It's not as technical as CE 376 and focuses more on policy, equity and public transportation. Schofer is a good lecturer who clearly has a strong interest and background in the field. Highly recommend!"
mcmk,civ_env,376,fall,Yu Nie,5.20,5.00,5.60,5.80,5.40,8.00,"The lectures were very useful, and so were the office hours. Professor Marco lectures very clearly, is extremely organized and is always happy to meet to answer questions about the material."

The only thing I would change about it is to not have rushed content. I always felt that we run overtime because there are too many slides to start within the slide deck.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in how engineering challenges can be affected and driven by human behavior and choices, particularly in a policy and economics context. The integration of social sciences and engineering was very unique and allowed me to reconceptualize a lot of issues and approach them with fresh methods and insights. Amanda was an excellent instructor who organized the course extremely well and communicated a broad array of topics in an accessible and engaging way. I looked forward to every session!"

The main criticisms I have are: A. a lot of the programs we needed to use do not work on Mac computers, and are only available on 3 computers, which meant that people were often competing over using the computers. Not a responsibility of the teaching staff necessarily, but it would be great if they could talk to IT about installing the programs on other computers. B. The end of the quarter, we were hit with a lot of time consuming assignments such as making a detailed 3d model and completing a fairly complex structural assignment, when structural considerations had not really played much role at all int he design process until that point, and many people did not have a background in CivEng. C. The final 3D model required a lot of supply purchasing out of nowhere, and I wish that the financial burden on students was considered more."

,,,,,,,,,,,"This was an awesome class. All of the guest lectures were super super interesting, and it was so satisfying to complete and present the project, and throughout the project and at the end we got very thoughtful feedback that made it exciting to think about progressing with the project into Capstone. My biggest criticism would be that we spent a lot of time on the case studies at the beginning, and while they were helpful I think this could have been shorter, and I wish we had learned Lumion earlier. The class does expect enough people coming in with knowledge of 3D modelling to put at least 1 person on each team too– this worked out fine this year but would be difficult in the future if this wasn't the case."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor are extremely helpful and understanding. Very casual class with presentation at the end
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm glad that Northwestern offers an urban planning class and, like with the architecture sequence, it benefits by having adjunct professors who are experts in their field. This class makes the most sense for those who have taken the architecture sequence as it requires a degree of technical proficiency with 3D modeling tools that are taught in those classes. Structurally, while the assignment order was really good, the mid–quarter shake up with the teams is more disruptive than helpful and having optional tutorials on how to get better with the software might prevent some the pacing issues that cropped up in the last half. Other than that I'm really happy to have taken the class and would definitely recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Fun class, you learn a lot about urban planning and the ways to think about laying out such a large–scale project. The process can get annoying if your team encounters a difficult hurdle to overcome in terms of design, but as long as you think strategically about how to design solutions to the problems you encounter, the design will be good."
,,,,,,,,,,,"great class, group projects, enjoyed going to class and meeting the instructors as they are professional architects. Highly recommend, not hard. Fun class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good class, would recommend it for a tech elective! Parts can be difficult if you don't have an architecture background, but Neil and Tom did a good job of making sure each final group had 1–2 people who had Rhino experience. It got time–consuming towards the end of the quarter, but it's manageable if your group stays on track and the feedback/studio classes were helpful in making progress. It was rewarding to see the final project unfold and presenting it at the Perkins & Will downtown office was an exciting experience."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really interesting class, definitely more focused on design and not as technical as most engineering classes. Large emphasis on 3D modeling for the final project but we were never truly taught how to do this – makes the last few weeks of the course a confusing hustle."

,,,,Giorgia Chinazzo,,,,,,,Professor Chinazzo provided great amounts of background on the content and helped us learn about a range of building science topics while focusing the course on thermodynamics and also exposing us to different applications. The course was overall very interesting and not too hard to follow along with.
,,,,Giorgia Chinazzo,,,,,,,"Great class, covers a variety of different topics related to building science."
,,,,Giorgia Chinazzo,,,,,,,"This class is basically an applied physics course that covers various areas related to building performance: heat gains/losses, energy calculations, humidity, etc. You can tell that Prof. Chinazzo really really cares about this class and is constantly taking feedback and making changes. The classes can be dense and move fast, but Prof. Chinazzo does a really great job at digging into *why* the equations work and their real life applications. The midterm and final felt fair in their coverage of the material, especially if you go through and make sure you understand the problem sets. Really the only thing I would change is the pacing–– perhaps starting the excursuses a little earlier so it's a more even split between the midterm and final. But I also understand the desire to have more conceptual, higher level stuff in the first half of the quarter such as readings. Overall one of the best McCormick classes I've taken and I finished the quarter feeling like I understood building performance so much better!"
,,,,Giorgia Chinazzo,,,,,,,"Honestly, I went into this class having no clue what to expect from it, having never heard of what Building Science was, but this turned out to be one of the best classes I've ever taken at Northwestern. Chinazzo makes the class incredibly engaging, and while the exercises and exams are difficult, she adequately prepares us for everything within class, and there wasn't a day where I felt like I was learning something unnecessary even if some of the topics were more boring."

,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot about how to use Rhino and Grasshopper, and also, how to evaluate the thermal and visual comfort. But the workload is a bit heavy for me, at least 7hrs per week. Overall is interesting and helpful."

Dr. Chen is wonderful and exposed us to so many Python libraries that are incredibly helpful for cleaning and parsing data.

The class was enjoyable and the material was interesting to learn about. Prof. Aristilde has high expectations for her students, so the pressure is present in class. She is forgiving and understanding, wanting her students to succeed. For quizzes, be sure to study every subject taught in class well, but be prepared to apply these concepts to new contexts. Case studies require ~20hrs, so be sure to start early so you have time to go to office hours"

As a non–engineering student, I would have liked for the course to focus less on technologies being developed and more on how technologies are implemented in societies. The readings were never too long and generally very interesting. I appreciated that the position papers allowed us to reflect and determine what we thought of the readings before coming to class. The class had some guest speakers, but again, they both focused on technologies for reducing water scarcity and not on the implementation side. The most unique part about this course was being able to attend a symposium on the NU campus directly related to the topic of the course.

,,,,,,,,,,,"Lectures went over useful reporting skills and AP style. However, due to strict word limits, assignments often felt limiting. Deas is a diligent fact checker (he *will* Medill–F you if you're not careful) but often commits errors in his own grading, or leaves inconsistencies in assignment rubrics. It also felt that he was grading our assignments purely based on technical skill, rarely engaging with the actual content of our writing and reporting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Amazing course. Professor Deas is probably my favorite teacher I have had at NU. I laughed a lot during class. Deas also makes expectations very clear and I appreciated his honesty tremendously. For the most part, you know when he likes or dislikes a part of your story. Some assignments I loved and others I did not, but all of them helped me grow. I was nervous the first week because Deas runs a tight ship, but this all turned out for the better. 10/10 class. Grateful for the quality of instruction."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Deas is a great professor! I came into this class with no journalism experience but was able to succeed because of Professor Deas’ clear instructions. He always provides examples for assignments, so you always know what he’s looking for. If you can, take this class with Deas! It’s a fun and extremely helpful class! As Deas would say, don’t Mickey Mouse around and you’ll be fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Coming into this class, I was lucky because I had a journalism background beforehand. I definitely knew a lot more than classmates before coming into this and so I can see how this class would have been harder for other students. I think people have heard of Professor Deas and are wary of his reputation as very strict, but I think his teaching style is exactly what young journalists need. He expects a lot from his students and offers very specific feedback which is important. Sometimes his assignments could be confusing and offer conflicting details to what he says in class, but asking questions and emailing him is usually the best route. Don’t be scared to take his class because you will come out with skills that are necessary to succeed in journalism!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I definitely learned and believe that this class helped me become a better journalist. However, it was definitely not my favorite––it wasn't structured the way I learn nor did I think that there was quite enough communication to students for an entry–level class. That being said, I still did enjoy the class experience, it gives you an opportunity to connect with your classmates and really get into the thick of interviewing people and understanding the expectations for journalism at Northwestern."
jour,jour,201,winter,Desiree Hanford,3.17,3.68,3.81,3.31,2.79,5.54,"I did not like lectures because most of them were just ""filler,"" if that makes any sense. I believe that if we had only had like two lectures, maybe three, where the Professors taught the essential things the class would have been much better."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was nervous about this class, but it actually helped me grow a lot both as a reporter and a person."
,,,,,,,,,,,"No, it was pointless. Get rid of this course if broadcast is the student's focus"
,,,,,,,,,,,It is a lot of writing and that was good experience
,,,,,,,,,,,201–1 is not that bad! I enjoy it.

The news feature was set up in kind of a nitpicky way but I had a good time writing and reporting it. This class is so much easier if you've done campus publications, so GO WORK FOR THEM (especially The Daily, no one will ever be more rigorous than your exhausted editor at 9 p.m.)"
,,,,,,,,,,,I didn't enjoy lecture because I felt like we were learning things that we had already learned in fall quarter. But I liked lab because we actually got to dive more in depth about what we were learning and we did assignments using the things we learned.
,,,,,,,,,,,"201–1 lecture was probably the most boring class I had to sit through spring quarter. I don't think we ever covered a topic that was helpful or related to the corresponding week's assignment. Overall can tell there was not much planning or effort put into slides and engaging with students (evident with the many typos and lack of clarity in syllabus.) Drained my interest in journalism; maybe if you're into super structured, repetitive reporting this will be enjoyable but I hated it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course felt like professors were just trying to fill time for all 10 lectures. Either information was a repeat of what we had already discussed or fluff, especially the two improv labs. I appreciated the efforts to get people to come in and speak, however, it felt like a strategy to fill up time. Don't feel like I learned much from lectures, most learning happened with assignments and personal experience."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think that this lecture series was my favorite one so far. In the past I found the lectures to be redundant, but these were very helpful throughout the quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,De Los Santos is the goat.
,,,,,,,,,,,"For the most part, the lectures for this course seemed almost entirely unrelated to anything we were working on in our labs. It felt like readings were assigned for the sake of being readings. I would merely skim them because they were never about something I didn't know before and they would usually be talked about elsewhere, so I didn't feel like I was missing much. Some guest lecturers were great and others were absolutely terrible. Show up to lectures for the attendance questions and don't worry about the rest."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is fine. Jour 201–1 lectures are very boring but they're not difficult. This class is just not suited for a lecture–style class, and the guest speakers are cool at first until they keep coming and you start to feel like they're just filling time. Still, the lab instructors are understanding– at least mine was– so you will survive. I would not say it's hard at all, just get ahead on your interviews and pick topics for your stories that are personally interesting to you."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a lot. It's a really great learning tool and will most certainly help your skills in regard to writing articles, but it's a ton of work. There's basically something due every week, and it takes a long time to get all those interviews. Also, the teachers can be sticklers and that can get annoying, but it does teach you to proofread. The reading materials for the course were pretty useless, and I don't think they were very necessary since we went over everything they said in class. Additionally, the lectures are so boring and basically serve no function. However, lab is great."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I didn't like the lecture portion of this class. To me, the material we were learning wasn't that interesting. I've also been an aspiring journalist since the sixth grade, so it has to be really boring for me to be uninterested."
,,,,,,,,,,,The lectures are very boring and not useful to the rest of the class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The monday lectures were really boring and I found myself never engaged to what was being presented. It was pretty easy though, you just had to pay enough attention to answer the lecture quizzes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Sometimes the lectures were boring but I enjoyed hearing from people who work in journalism and getting feedback on our written stories, then having a chance to re–write them."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is your typical journalism class. Most of the assignments were very straightforward, as long as you don't procrastinate with your sourcing, you'll be fine. You have to talk to a lot of people on the street to get interviews which was a bit annoying, but it made me more confident in walking up to random people and asking for quotes. Your experience in this class more or so depends on the instructor you get for your lab. In my opinion, much more manageable and fun than 201–2."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm not sure why we need such a long lecture component to this class. It was nice to hear about different beats, but between combined lectures with the video class and wholly uninteresting guest speakers, I'm not sure how effective the lectures were. In particular, the Crain's Chicago Business guest speaker spent a good chunk of time talking just about the Crain's editorial structure. After that, I think almost everyone had tuned out. In general, I also think Medill's freshman curriculum still needs to change. From what upperclassmen have told me, the core problem of this curriculum still remains – students get thrown into the deep end of the pool during their reporting classes. I think 202 spent way too much time on theoreticals. Instead, the first journalism class should focus on basic reporting skills, including how to find good stories and localize scoops, how to interview, how to look through public documents, etc. With each reporting assignment, we could integrate different journalism ethics concepts, since I think 202's case studies were too abstract for us to gain a lot of value from them. Then, in the video and writing classes, we could learn how to package and present information, whether through print or broadcast. This way, students can gain a solid reporting foundation in a lower stakes environment, then move onto more rigorous production oriented classes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class gives you the basics of print reporting. If you aren't interested in print then it is tedious but I understand why it is necessary. Start writing your stories early and source even earlier. Sourcing is the hardest part. Also, source more than you need – you can always man–on–the–street if you have trouble sourcing. Lab is good, lecture is the same as it is in all other 202/201 courses. We have had so much of the same style lecture that it is kinda redundant."
jour,jour,201,winter,Desiree Hanford,3.43,4.00,3.71,3.93,3.00,5.28,I mean you have to take it lol
,,,,,,,,,,,"Although I learned a lot in this course, it did feel like sometimes we were being thrown into the field with little to no preparation. Although the high expectations for the course have made preparation into the field easier, the course did induce a lot of stress."
,,,,,,,,,,,The lectures were relaxed but boring.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Bringing in speakers helped introduce us to different topics from different journalists, which made lectures less monotonous. However, most of these introductions were not particularly eye–opening. There were select interesting points made in these lectures, but overall these lectures were not very stimulating."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I found lectures to not be very helpful. It was valuable time that could have been spent with our lab instructors in our break out classes. Medill just brings in guest lecturers who are interesting, but after awhile, they sort of just say the same thing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lecture is completely unnecessary; there should just be three lab sections per week. This quarter, it was mostly guest speakers that came in and often rambled about their work without giving particularly insightful comments. I wish there was more room for assignments like Q&A interviews, magazine articles, or other pieces that gave us more creative freedom. And Journalism Jeoparty is a mess during the last lecture of the quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Every class, we went through current events and talked about publications/the journalism industry worked. I feel like I learned a lot about the style of writing and found myself engaged in exploring the basics of journalism."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lecture component of this course wasn't the most stimulating part, for sure. I appreciated hearing from industry professionals guest speakers quite frequently, but I feel like some of the beat reporting/some other speakers were redundant. They had repeated information we had already learned in 202 and our previous 201 lecture (like the infamous ""what is news?"" question), which was frustrating at times."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty good, standard journalism class"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The assignments for the course were great, but I wish it was just lab instead of lecture Monday, lab on Wednesday/Friday."
,,,,,,,,,,,Not too hard. Kind of an annoying class to take before you can take the fun ones but whatever.
jour,jour,201,spring,Desiree Hanford,4.03,3.93,3.73,3.50,3.72,7.40,"Good overview of print journalism, but some of the assignments are too easy or too difficult"
,,,,,,,,,,,This lecture is boring. It was all material covered in 202 but repeated.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Don't take this class if you don't need it. If you do, bear in mind that it will be news, period. Suffer through the news emphasis."
,,,,,,,,,,,"201–1 was what I had previously heard a lot of former students say the class may look like. It was really hard not to doubt whether I wanted to continue to pursue journalism as my primary major given that the class seemed very rigid in terms of what was expected from us. Coming from a background with very minimal journalism experience before Medill, I hoped that this class would foster my enthusiasm for the practice of reporting."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was very helpful with gaining journalistic experience. A lot of the stories I wrote in class helped me with coming up for pitches for campus publications. The lectures were also very engaging and the conversations we had there were stuck with me as I took my knowledge outside of the classroom.
,,,,,,,,,,,"201–1 is difficult, but essential to this major. You write a story nearly every week (for some weeks, you do rewrites of previous stories) and each of those stories require you to go out and interview non–Medill affiliated people. It's a bit jarring at first, but after taking the course, I feel more confident than ever in my journalistic skills than every before."
,,,,,,,,,,,Sometimes lecture and lab time felt a little dragged out but it's a cool course and is not as bad as the reputation it has.
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was very redundant and sometimes the rubric was a little difficult to follow because we are limited as student journalists
,,,,,,,,,,,"Although some lectures were not helpful, I found that gaining real world experience and reporting in the Evanston community really helped me hone the skills we spoke about in class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think I enjoyed writing (obviously, since that is what I love to do). That being said, the lectures were not stimulating at all. They were a waste of time in large part. If you have any experience in journalism, this will feel like you randomly got placed in your first intro to journalism class again. That is the same with JOUR 202. There is a really strong case, I believe, for students to be able to test out of this course. Especially considering that the articles are all between 300–700 words. If you have a portfolio of work that proves you are capable of consistently producing short pieces of work like that, there is no point in making a kid cruise through this class with a 96% the entire quarter. As is the case in any class at Medill, most professors are incredibly well–qualified and experienced. I have known Desi for quite some time now and she is an incredible person and journalist. I wish people at Medill understood how much she actually does for the school to make things run smoothly. Desi is a superhero. In the experience I had to listen to Professor Ward's lectures, she honestly was not my favorite. It often felt like she was talking to us like elementary school students. I know that tone is a difficult thing to change because it is largely grounded in subconscious speaking patterns but it is really important when teaching a class. Kids worked really hard to get here and I think the facilitation of each lecture could have been a little more professional."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class isn't fun or educational, and in many instances made me cry, but you're probably taking it because it's mandatory. All I can say is that 90% of this class is showing up on time and keeping your mouth shut, so if you want the grade make sure to start doing that from the beginning."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was really tough, but it helped me become a better journalist."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I did not find anything worthwhile in the lecture, other than the lectures where Prof. Hanford and Prof. Ward discussed important components of AP Style and how to write well. Other than that, they were pointless. As someone who is not intending to go into journalism as a career, I was disappointed that the majority of the lectures discuss the career aspects of journalism, which, frankly, I do not care about. Prof. Hanford and Prof. Ward are great lecturers, but the guest lecturers were often mediocre at best."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class really gets you involved in journalism. It requires you to write stories on a weekly basis (pretty much), and it really forces you to step out of your comfort zone to reach sources and talk to them. I learned and grew a lot in this class but there are definitely growing pains, so give yourself grace and you will learn a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lecture materials are very repetitive of what we already learned last quarter in JOUR 202, so it was extremely boring. I wish there was more time in between the assignment due dates for stories and that the word count was greater."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was extremely involved in reporting in high school, but this course completely refined my abilities! Overall, I learned a lot about what I thought I knew."
,,,,,,,,,,,"These lectures are very similar to 202's lectures, but there's a lot less reading, which is appreciated. The readings are pretty interesting and the lectures had some cool guest speakers, including Omar Jimenez. Overall, not a bad lecture especially if you have a good lab, too."
,,,,,,,,,,,I was really happy with this course because I feel like I was able to learn a lot of skills that will be applicable to my career.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was very simple and did not require a ridiculous amount of effort. When she was giving lectures, professor Hanford did a good job at covering the basics. There were also a lot of guest speakers, and they were very interesting and oftentimes added another layer to the things we covered in class. Overall, I enjoyed my experience in this class and I felt like my skills as a journalist were improved."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a difficult but important class for anyone who wants to go into journalism. the assignments do pertain to a journalism major, but the workload does feel overwhelming, especially toward the end of the quarter. This class is not impossible but requires time management and commitment."
,,,,,,,,,,,Lecture were not good very boring did not learn a thing but the assignment were great because they actually taught you journalism
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was not as hard as I expected. Yes, it is very time–consuming, and you have to write one big story per week (once I even had to write two stories in one week at the same time), but it is manageable. The theory they give during the lectures is usually obvious and not different from jour 202. Readings are also mostly boring. However, it is a lot of practice, and you actually learn how to report fast."
jour,jour,201,spring,Desiree Hanford,3.85,3.88,3.96,3.80,3.51,7.01,Oof. The lectures sucked. The readings were just not that enlightening either. This class was saved by the lab section.
,,,,,,,,,,,"201–1 lecture was fine. I didn't find a lot of the lectures or lecture speakers interesting. Hanford is a really tough grader and very strict in general. No extensions no matter what. The worst part was most likely the final lecture, a parody version of Jeopardy, which I, and many others found to be unorganized and unnecessarily stressful."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Compared to the other introductory–level journalism courses, this one was really similar to the others. The only difference, of course, is the writing aspect. Lectures were identical to 202s, which sometimes made the information redundant. While I love Medill's definition of objectivity, it doesn't take very long to understand it. I felt like this class repeated a lot of material we learned previously, which made it really hard to appreciate it. I felt that the lab sections were way more useful than the lectures. The lectures were beneficial at times, though. It was really cool to hear from alumni currently in the field and see people doing practical things with their Medill degrees. This class was pretty standard as far as lectures go."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I did enjoy the course, although it was quite work–heavy. I think also I enjoyed the lectures more than labs, and it all depends on the lab professor you have for how much you get out of the course itself. I felt the grading and teaching styles between different instructors was astronomical, and most students come out of the course, it seems, with completely different experiences depending on the expertise of their professors. For example, if one professor was a lifestyle magazine writer and another a sports writer, the information you come away with in terms of techniques, what's the most important, and the types of stories you're encouraged to write are completely different, as well as their expectations of what makes a great story. Overall, I liked the course, but I think there is some work that needs to be done to make it applicable to all fields of journalism, perhaps basing lab instructor assignments on student interests within the field."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's a stickler not gonna lie. Kinda took the fun out of journalism and writing. Wasn't much room for creativity – it was all straight, boring print newspaper. And no one in my class, including me, was really interested in that path."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course readings are straightforward and the lecture speakers are great. Overall, labs are more productive because you can practice what was learned in the lecture."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class confirmed that I am not built to be a journalist. If you enjoy reporting, perhaps you will like it more than I did. Even still, I found lectures were incredibly unproductive. They were combined with the video journalism lab sections, so the material did not feel specific or tailored. In lab section, too, I do not feel I was taught any new material or information –– every class, we simply went over AP style rules and editing. Perhaps this is just to be expected with an intro level journalism course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was excellent throughout the duration of the quarter. The professor gave engaging lectures every week with several guest speakers that allowed the students to actively learn more about certain career paths in journalism. There was an attendance question asked at the end of each lecture that students were able to answer with their own insight. Overall, this was a greatly beneficial course during the quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures themselves were not too bad. Lab sections and assignments were a little bit tougher. Be prepared to be uncomfortable in this course, especially when learning how to interview."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think this course was definitely challenging and was not the most interesting. You had to write an article every single week which became very stressful at times. You will definitely be put out of your comfort zone and become a better journalist because of it, but overall the class is one you just need to get through."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Though the assignments and my professor's feedback was very helpful to my writing skills, I do not feel I gained anything from the lecture portion of the class. It wasn't engaging and it didn't provide me with many skills. I wish we could have used the time to do more activities or work on more technical writing skills, with a few lessons that were actually helpful like the one about ethics and libel."
,,,,,,,,,,,It was okay.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved the content they covered in lecture as well as the amazing guest speakers they brought on. Overall, the lectures felt pretty long but were full of informative content."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As someone who is hoping to do print in the future, this course was my first exposure to being formally taught how to write for a publication. It took some getting used to and it definitely hurt my confidence as a writer at times, but Jessica was explicit in that she wanted us to know that she was there for us and she only wanted the best for us. She was really supportive and understanding, which motivated me to try. Also, I really appreciated her candidness –– she was willing to share her experiences in the field with us to give us an idea of what it is truly like to be a journalist. She also taught us practical skills (like safety and interviewing tactics) that I will absolutely take with me throughout the rest of my time at Medill. If you go into this class with an open mind and a good work ethic, you will do well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Lots of writing and reporting and time spent outside the class in general, which might be challenging if you haven't done some sort of journalism before, but overall not a hard class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is definitely challenging, and you need to talk 1–on–1 with your professors a lot in order to succeed. I feel like this class relies on you taking the initiative, and you can't be afraid to ask questions or for help. I would not recommend that you take a bunch of other content–heavy courses at the same time as this class. I did not know this and took another class that required a lot of reading and writing, so doing both was a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall I thought this course was pretty good, the assignments pushed me to improve my interviewing skills and start to think more like a journalist. I can definitely see improvements in my writing and confidence with reaching out to sources and conducting interviews. It was a good amount of work but definitely manageable if you don't put it off too late, since you will need to get quotes for all of the assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures for 201–1 were cool because you got to listen to a lot of famous alumni, but they could get boring after a bit. They did not need to be 1 hour and 20 minutes long."
,,,,,,,,,,,"To me, the lectures didn't really correlate with the lab, but I still really enjoyed the class. It was challenging but helped me learn so much about how to interview, contact sources, and clean up my writing via AP style. The guest speakers were also very interesting and I felt they had a lot of good insights for us in terms of their current jobs and experiences."
,,,,,,,,,,,"For lectures: The same old disorganized lectures like 202. You could probably get one or two new things out of a million things mentioned in the lecture, that's about it. They teach in a very conservative way. Attendance was a big part of this class, which could be frustrating and annoying – We were sometimes watching zoom lectures and answering attendance questions on canvas, but they don't put a tab or anything, so it was really easy to forget to do it. The only good thing about the lectures is that if the guest speakers end their talks early, they would let you go early. Labs are more helpful, but I would still argue that we don't need 80–min to cover all the things. I wish we could instead use that time to contact sources and do more peer editing. From my observations from my friends, Different lab instructors grade differently and have their preferences for what a good story looks like, so the experiences may be very different."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not trying to scare anyone, but if I hadn't gotten lucky with my lab instructor, I probably would have dropped out of Medill this quarter. To be fair, this work in this class was more manageable than I was expecting. The assignment lengths and deadlines aren't too bad. It's the interviews that will get you. Finding enough good sources, interviewing them, and then transcribing those interviews is honestly pretty brutal, but I felt like a real journalist. I feel like that part of the class was necessary for our learning. The lectures were totally disorganized and not very helpful or applicable to the lab, but I really liked lab time. I think my biggest issue, in general, is that the grading, teaching, and structure of each lab and lab instructor are completely and totally different. There are people who I know put far less effort into their articles and got much higher grades than other labs just because of the way the instructor graded them, so may the odds be ever in your favor for your lab group (and your GPA)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This lecture is essentially an extension of the topics that were covered in 202. Attendance to lectures is very important, but the attendance questions weren't hard. I generally enjoyed 201–1 lectures more than the 202 lectures because we also heard from quite a few guest speakers."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I've done reporting and writing before, so I didn't learn a lot. The JOUR 201–1 lectures are boring. The content is just a refresher from JOUR 202. Both professors were not engaging. Most of the readings were succinct and useful though."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures definitely didn't help me learn. Hanford brought in various professionals and alumni to allow students to ask questions and learn more about professional journalism, but frankly, these lectures (and especially Hanford's lectures) were quite boring and unhelpful most of the time. The only lecture I found valuable was Debbie Cenziper's."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Honestly, the lecture portion of 201–1 is not great. The lectures are not related to the labs or assignments at all, and they acknowledge this at the beginning of the quarter, which just made me more frustrated. Frankly, we learned nothing really applicable to the work we were doing in lab during these lectures, but the lectures were required, so I attended every single one. You will learn a lot in your lab, though, so stick this course out, but just be prepared for the lackluster Monday lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course truly helped me to learn how to write and report effectively. I really gained a lot of confidence in my interviewing skills and have a better understanding of different journalistic theories.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The readings were pretty helpful, and I liked some of the classes (like our discussion about ethics and our breaking news press conference), but other classes felt pretty pointless."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This lecture is calm from the storm of the labs that accompany it. It's not too much of a burden on top of your other work and will genuinely help you learn from real journalists working out in the field. Listen closely, do the readings and you'll be good!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Decent class overall. The most helpful/interesting aspect was the guest lectures. Journalism Jeoparty, however, might've been the single most frustrating event I've participated in at Northwestern thus far."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really wanted to learn about investigative journalism and learn about people.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a weeder course. If you are unsure if you want to pursue journalism, this course will push you one way or another. It is purposefully fast–paced and the assignments can be challenging under the time constraints. It is definitely manageable, but if you realize you don't want to pursue journalism, this course may be painful to push through."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty disappointing course for my first reporting and writing class at Medill. Everything is dependent on what professor you have for lab, and they all have different criteria for grading. It made me question what the proper journalistic practices were, because I would get deducted for things that friends in other labs wouldn't."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Lecture was 80 minutes of my week I can’t get back. While we actually learned and wrote in lab, lecture was useless. Most times I just sat there without even taking my computer out because I could find anything relevant later and attendance was mandatory. It was unorganized, and the attendance questions seemed like a pointless reason to keep us coming to class. Your grade depends greatly on your relationship with your lab professor, as points are essentially deducted from 950 and there are tiers for each letter. This means it’s nearly impossible to recover from one bad piece. I loved my lab professor so I did well, but I have friends who really struggled, especially with Prof Hanford and Prof Ward."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I’m a Weinberg student who was thinking about switching into Medill. The course challenged me to to out of my comfort zone and approach random people on the street. I had never before taken a journalism class, so it was a bit tough at first, but I got the hang of it at the end. I had 3 other Weinberg friends who enrolled in this course but dropped it before 3 weeks. Obviously non–negotiable to take if you’re a Medill student, but Weinberg students, be aware that you might have 3 courses during the quarter instead of 4. Overall, I recommend if you’re interested in practicing journalism and interviewing people and writing on strict deadlines."
,,,,,,,,,,,Lecture was extremely boring and did not apply to actual reporting and writing at all.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed reporting on a variety of topics and getting to interview people every week! It was fun, thought it could be frustrating at times when sources don't get back to you in a timely manner or you encounter obstacles in reporting that are out of your control."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I did not enjoy this course – several people in my class considered dropping it even though that would mean a major change, and it felt more like a weed out than a fun introduction to journalism."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot because the assignments were very hands on focused! A lot of people say it is hard but I don't think so. Don't let people intimidate you. As long as you get your interviews early you are set. Overall, beautiful class: You'll learn a lot!"
jour,jour,202,winter,Caryn Ward,3.65,4.25,4.35,3.62,3.44,5.27,"This course was organized very poorly in my opinion. It started out strong with a few introductory lectures on PremierePro and editing basics, but then things just got irrelevant or repetitive. Labs were extremely unstandardized so friends in a different lab would be doing a completely different exercise than I was doing on a given week. Not to mention we just stopped doing exercises altogether half way in and the weird structure of splitting video/writing labs into both morning and afternoon made it so I would have a live lecture probably twice a month by the end of the quarter (as opposed to once a week.) Overall, this course was hard to stay engaged in because of how disorganized it was and how little the instructors attempted to make it an equal experience for everyone."
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,"Again, a lot of transferrable skills. Especially in this digital age, it's just good to know how to record and edit video to make a cohesive story."
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,The lectures were pretty boring and I did not feel like I learned a whole ton but the lab days were much better.
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,"Most lectures didn't feel super helpful (for instance, learning Adobe Premiere Pro basics in a large group setting), but the guest speakers were a little more interesting. Some speakers covered topics that related well to what were were learning and working on in the course, as well as gave helpful tips and advice through the Q&A."
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,Was a nice intro to video
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,I feel like this course gave me a good foundation for the basic fundamentals of video storytelling that I think will be valuable in my career going forward.
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,"Instructors tried their best to make each lecture new and interesting, I really enjoyed listening to some of the guest speakers they would bring on."
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,Quite dull at times to come to lecture as I felt it personally covered aspects of journalism I already knew.
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,The first three lectures are the only ones I honestly paid attention to. The labs are what's important.
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,"There isn't much homework, just like two short assignments."
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,Go to lecture just for attendance.
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,"I enjoyed the course overall because I liked how we learned about video journalism in lectures/heard from professionals then applied these skills to news packages. Sometimes the lectures felt unnecessary, but overall I learned a lot during this course."
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,"I think that this lecture was very helpful. The skills learned can definitely be applied to reporting and writing and also video journalism. I also think that taking turns between in–person and zoom lecture was very helpful because students learn better in certain environments, so by doing this it gives us all a chance to learn the way we do so best."
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,This course helped me learn a lot about Premiere Pro however most of the learning took place in lab and not lecture
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,I loved the lab section but the lecture is a bit of a bore. It’s a really great class overall though.
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,"The lab work for this course was pretty helpful. There's definitely a video learning curve at first, but it gives good practice. On the other hand, the joint lecture format didn't make a lot of sense, and I felt I didn't learn a whole lot from them."
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,"The lecture was good! It was slightly less engaging than lab, but interesting nonetheless!"
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,"This class was so fun!!! I loved getting to make news video stories. If you get Andy, he is great!! He lets you experiment, work with other people on getting b–roll and interviews, (you just have to edit separately), and is so chill and nice. He's always looking to help and really wants the class to feel low stress."
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,"I enjoyed the course, but only because I already knew how to do basic broadcast. I do not think I would feel the same if that weren't the case."
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,"I found lecture for this class pretty disappointing. I felt like it wasn't really necessary or helpful. Plus, due to the schedules of guest lecturers, they couldn't make it to both the morning and afternoon lectures, so half of our lectures were recorded anyway. There wasn't really an incentive to watch them either because the questions we had to answer afterwards were really straightforward and required more common sense than actual information. Lab was where I found I really learned about broadcast."
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,"Honestly, I found lecture to be a bit dull and far too long. Additionally, with regard to video journalism, I don’t believe our professors (though incredibly kind) were well–suited to teaching students the particulars of video journalism and Adobe Premiere. (Much of what I have learned concerning Premiere, I’ve had to teach myself.)"
,,,,Caryn Ward,,,,,,,Great practice for getting out there and reporting. The rigidness of the reporting style is frustrating but it's a required course.
jour,jour,202,winter,Caryn Ward,4.00,4.04,4.21,3.88,3.78,7.00,"This class is not necessarily difficult if you put in the effort. I had no past experience with video journalism and didn't feel like I was thrown into video journalism too fast. However, lectures felt largely like time fillers. They were not particularly engaging or taught us much new information. The three news package assignments were not too bad, however, they were time consuming. Grading on these were difficult. I don't feel like this class truly introduced us to the multifaceted field of video journalism or ignited a passion for it in any of us. It felt like all of us were just there because we had to be (including instructors) and just wanted to get it over with."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures really were not that bad. Sometimes a little boring or preachy, but really never terrible."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course brings in lots of guest lecturers which is nice and if you are interested in broadcast, the speakers actually have really good info. Sometimes they let out class early & sometimes you just watch a recording which is great. The class is pretty easy, just remember to do your observer report."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I feel like I got more from the course than I was expecting. Only three packages over the quarter didn't seem like a lot of work but I definitely put more work in than I was expecting. Lectures were interesting because we got to hear from Medill grads in the field, but I don't feel like they connected to the course content well, if at all. Attendance was necessary at those lectures—make sure to pay special attention to when you actually go in–person vs. watching a recording, as they put 201–1 and 201–2 students in the same lecture hall. The course was organized well and assignments were graded quickly. Journalism Jeoparty! was such a funny way to wrap up the course, partly because it was so disorganized. I hope that is corrected for future students..."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved video journalism, but the class itself was fine. The news packages were very rewarding but there was little guidance, so it was mostly self–taught. The labs and lectures were pretty pointless. I wish there was more practical lab assignments to get more guidance in class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course provided an elementary introduction to some of the essentials of practicing journalism, and somewhat helped me improve my skills in video journalism."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was a great introduction to video journalism because it clearly broke down everything students need to know about using Premiere Pro. Beginners should not be worried because the course starts with the basics and is catered toward various skill sets.
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's a good introduction to video journalism for those with no video experience, but the 2–minute time limit for assignments left very little room for more in–depth reporting. As someone who already took 201–1, the joint 201 lectures felt repetitive, as we mainly covered the same material. Overall, I felt like I completed this class with a good grasp on the fundamentals of writing, reporting, and editing for video, so I guess it's true to its name."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a lot of work, mostly because I don't think we were prepared adequately. In lecture, we pretty much just listened to guest speakers. It's very interesting but not teaching me anything new, and in lab, we pretty much just work on assignments. I felt like I lacked guidance in navigating premierepro and looking for stories to cover, which accumulated in a lot of homework. The way this class works is there is a video due every other week. So one week, you have nothing. Then the next, it is an absolute grind and a ton of work and effort."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is pretty chill, but it’s not the most entertaining. Don’t stress yourself out about it."
,,,,,,,,,,,I liked how I learned how to use premiere pro and we learned about multimedia storytelling. I also think it was helpful listening to the guest speakers and also learning more about ethical practices in journalism.
,,,,,,,,,,,The lectures for broadcast journalism were okay— a lot of it felt like repeated information from 202 because the lectures are combined with 201–1.
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is cool because you learn adobe but it can be stressful and the lectures are so goofy
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot and really enjoyed the curriculum of this class. With that being said, it was one of the most poorly organized classes I've ever taken in my life. Professors were not on the same page, lectures were disorganized, technology was never set up properly and always a delay. It was really bad. Some of the professors involved in the course didn't even know how to use Adobe, the primary editing software that we use in the class. I enjoyed learning about video journalism a lot, and it's worth noting that the work is more fun than challenging, but this is a flawed course."
jour,jour,202,spring,Caryn Ward,4.02,4.04,4.30,3.80,3.65,5.08,"This was a pretty basic overview of video–lectures didn't always feel relevant and the class was much easier than 201–1. It's a good intro to video, but if you aren't interested in video at all it's just another class to get through."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great TAs, the class is super easy and there's barely any work"
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is a great foundation! I had no experience and I was fine. I also learned a lot.
,,,,,,,,,,,The lectures weren’t terrible. The guest lecturers were awesome though. And my lab professor was great.
,,,,,,,,,,,Didn't love the Jeoparty at the end but overall the course was pretty good.
,,,,,,,,,,,NA
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures all across the board for first year journalism courses tend to be middle of the road, perhaps 202 excluded. I took 201–1 winter quarter, and I would say 201–2 did a much better job making sure the lectures were actually relevant to the assignments we were doing in lab, but it did drop the ball towards the second half of the quarter, with the profs bringing in guest lecturers almost every week. Yes, sometimes the guests would have interesting things to say, but it was completely outside the scope of the VIDEO JOURNALISM class we were supposedly taking; they need to do a better job connecting lecture and lab. So, as you take this course during your time at Medill, know that you will have to deal with the odd irrelevant lecture, but you'll probably learn something during it, it'll just be slightly vexing to attend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures was extremely disorganized to me. We would go through four powerpoints in one lecture, and so when you are trying to work and want to refer back to materials you are constantly clicking through different powerpoints. I also found it frustrating that the main editing lecture that gave me valuable information to efficiently edit was conducted via zoom making it hard to see all the small buttons on Premiere, but it was the same week of our first major project so I had to essentially watch the lecture while editing making the process so much longer."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was very helpful, and I am so glad that I now know how to properly use Premiere."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It didn't take a lot of effort, was interesting at times and overall an easy A. My only frustration would be I wish we really focused on how to edit and ways to make our videos better whether audio or visually."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great intro class!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Intro course for video/broadcast journalism. I came in with some experience in broadcast, through NNN, which gave me a nice headstart. I learned a lot about how to shoot a good video story, from camera angles to soundbites to graphics."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Incredibly easy course, but incredibly boring if you aren't interested whatsoever in video journalism."
,,,,,,,,,,,I was really pleased with the lectures throughout this quarter. I really enjoyed hearing from alumni. This was a lot better than 201–1.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought that this class was pretty pointless if you do not want to go into video journalism. It is a requirement for Medill, but if you have a good lab instructor and schedule interviews early it is not difficult to get an A."
,,,,,,,,,,,"God I hate Journalism Lecture. Lab is great, but lecture is a waste 95% of the time. Everything is so generalized that most of the time I just did other work. As for Prof. Caryn Ward, I’ve never really had to work with her, but some of my friends did and did not have a great experience. Also, Journalism Jeopardy is the most chaotic 80 minutes of the quarter, but for some strange reason I think I’m gonna miss seeing Desi and Caryn’s innovative ways to prevent buzzer cheating :)"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course was fairly basic. It was a requirement, so that's why I took it. If you aren't super interested in video journalism it won't be super fun but overall not a bad class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Honestly a great course! As a non–Medill class, this has made me so much more interested in Journalism overall."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is really about the basics about using Adobe Premiere and video editing/shooting footage, so it's perfect for those who don't have a lot of background in video. If you want to take your video editing skills to the next level though, a lot of it really is just observing other videos and self learning. The Watch & Reflect assignments are really helpful for doing that."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Even though this is a mandatory course I do feel like it helped me discover a new avenue for journalism that I would have never even tried otherwise, and the skills I learned from it are definitely applicable in the future. The course moves pretty fast with packages due every other week for the last 6 weeks or so but it is not unmanageable. They hold your hand throughout a lot of it and teach you what you need to know before delving into a news package so don’t worry about not having any experience! I did not and I still enjoyed the class. The lectures don’t relate as much to the content of the class besides the premiere lecture but the guest speakers are interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lecture component of 201–2 felt like a huge waste of time, and was extremely boring. It honestly felt like a joke because lectures were so not engaging and uninteresting. I appreciated the guest speakers that we had, but I believe that Medill should definitely reconsider how lectures in the freshman sequence of classes are structured. I loved labs and all of the assignments that we had, but lectures felt like such a waste to me and to a lot of my classmates."
,,,,,,,,,,,"For it being a required Medill class, this course is pretty good. You learn a good amount about video journalism and get the chance to learn how to use Adobe Premiere."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is AMAZING. I can't overemphasize how many crucial video journalism skills you will learn in 201–2. Very fun, manageable and teaches so many skills!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Boring and easy, and a little unnecessary. Lab was two different classes combined, so they could not focus on teaching things that I specifically needed to know. Instead, they focused on broad topics like what Northwestern teachers were doing in their free time, which was interesting at first but overall not useful to the class as a whole."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Caryn's lecture series was, as with the other first–year courses, mind–numbingly boring. I wouldn't take this class if it wasn't a requirement for Medill, even if it was a guaranteed A, which it definitely isn't. For Medill students, for the poor over–qualified professors they make teach this, for the guest speakers, and especially for those who actually wanted to learn principles of video journalism, this class was a complete waste of time and a disgrace to Northwestern."
,,,,,,,,,,,Lecture was not very useful for success in the course. Improv labs were also not very useful. Lab is where you learn
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was a little bit disappointed with this quarter of the first year journalism course program. Caryn isn't my favorite lecturer. I think she is likely a wonderful person and she is definitely beloved by many, but I think her tone often comes off as condescending to me and I don't ever feel that she is offering anything that insightful. She isn't some awful professor or anything but you would've thought her one hour monologues about premiere pro or whatever other topic were geared at either 5 year olds or 95 year olds the way they were delivered. I completely tuned those out, hopped on premiere pro right after for about 15 minutes and learned all I needed to know by just messing around with the technology. That is a common theme in this class: most all of the 80 minute lectures could very well have been an email sent out to the class and we could've used that extra class period as a lab session."
,,,,,,,,,,,Hard to get through some times. Its relatively easy and forgiving so that's good.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Im not going to lie, this was one of the hardest classes I have ever taken. It requires you not to be really on top of interviews, videoing, and editing. I learned a lot about how to use adobe premiere, however I don't think a lot of what I learned will be transferable to my future career aspirations"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was glad we not only learned about generic broadcasts, but audio, business, and more."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The usual lectures for video journalism are not very interesting and I do not think I learned as much in them as I did durning the lab of this course. However, I defiantly enjoyed the guest speakers we had and found it very interesting to hear from people working in professional journalism."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, this class was great for learning the basics of video journalism."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was really intimidated of the class at first since video is not really my favorite medium of journalism. However after the first package was due, I found out how much fun video journalism actually is and really enjoyed it. While I don't think I'll go into video, I still think it was a great introductory class and learned a lot."
jour,jour,202,spring,Caryn Ward,3.86,3.86,4.00,3.49,3.55,5.46,"This was so horribly organized, the professors and the lab professors weren't communicating at all, none of the lectures ever matched up with what we were doing in class, my lab professor didn't do half of the assignments we were supposed to. It's a required course if you're in Medill so you'll get through it it's just very frustrating."
,,,,,,,,,,,"201–2 was a lot easier than 201–1 due to the pace being much slower. But for the first package, professors didn't communicate well how to edit/shoot which made for a very overwhelming experience. I think the professors expected everyone could just pick everything up after one lecture and then learn the rest on their own (which was definitely not the case for me). But after the first package, most students got the hang of it and everything ran smoothly."
,,,,,,,,,,,Mediocre course. Be prepared to have to teach yourself everything related to Premiere or rely on your NNN friends.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The 201–2 lecturers were nice enough, but the lectures themselves weren't that useful. The only lectures I found actually helpful were the ones at the beginning of the quarter that taught me about Premiere Pro and other facets of video reporting. The rest of the lectures felt largely pointless."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was very disappointed in this course, particularly in the virtually non–existent organization. I was only taking it because it’s a requirement and absolutely don’t recommend unless you have to take it. 1/3 of our lectures were cancelled and we had to watch recordings, 1/3 were loosely relevant guest lectures, and the only 3 that professor Ward actually lectures for were underwhelming. In addition we were required to attend 2 completely irrelevant improv workshops in place of discussion sections. This class completely depends on who your professor is for your discussion section, it is basically a completely different class between the different teachers. There is no correlation between lecture and lab, and no consensus/correlation between the different lab instructors of what was happening in class. Expectations were very unclear – I got points of for things that were not even on the rubric for assignments, and that we had never even been taught to do."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's definitely a lot of work, but if you make sure to work ahead of the deadlines you should be fine. I liked the professor a lot, but I wish I got to learn print journalism from him rather than video journalism, considering he's a print journalist by trade. Video journalism will not be for everyone, and this class will tell you whether its for you. Make sure to focus on your storytelling, and try your best."
,,,,,,,,,,,Lecture for 201–2 was not very helpful. I had trouble staying focused in class and didn't feel like the information was very useful for my career as a journalist. Lab for this class helped me improve on the basics of video journalism and provided me with feedback on my work.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I had never done video before this class, so I learned A TON because I had to in order to do well. It was fun at times, and I'm proud of my progress, but this was a bit of a stressful class as a beginner. Luckily, most of my classmates were in the same boat, so that made it easier to learn together. There were three news packages, a re–edit at the end of the quarter, and watch and reflects (super quick write–ups after watching a news segment of your choice). The best part of this class is that everything is turned in by the end of week nine, so I'm totally done with this class right now and can focus on my finals in my other classes."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course helped me to learn the basics of video journalism and was very interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I did not like that I had to take it sense I know I dod not want to do video but overall it was good, it was difficult at first and I felt like the lectures did not help but once I played around with it got the hang of it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Once again, this class is required for journalism majors, and it is the same sort of structure with the largely unproductive lectures and actually important lab time. That said, the lectures don’t require much work, so that’s nice. This quarter we had to do 2 improv classes during our lab times, which was a total drag. For one, we were missing time where our instructors could actually help keep us on course and give us help on our news packages. Second, there were a lot of random improv games that were hard to engage with at 10am, and they would always try to relate them back to interviewing and it always felt like such a reach. Overall, it’s not that big of a deal, but it definitely was frustrating, especially when your improv time is scheduled the day before a big assignment is due."
,,,,,,,,,,,"JOUR 201–1 is a good class. The lectures are nothing special but the lecture components are fairly easy to manage and interesting, depending on your interest in video journalism. Some of the lectures are more technical and some are more conceptual. Going to lecture is important to your grade as well, but it's nice that some of the lectures are virtual."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Don't take this class unless it's a major requirement. You don't learn that much about how to do video, at least with Hullinger. He's overly obsessed with AI and doesn't actually seem to have productive feedback in the realm of video journalism."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lecture for 201–2 was not the most pleasant experience. The 1 hour 20 minute lectures could get very tiresome very fast, as it wasn't engaging at all. I had no motivation to listen because the material presented was not vaguely helpful."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot in this course, but also in a way that was easy to digest and understand. I really enjoyed the teaching style as it never felt like I was being flooded with too much at once. I was a bit nervous coming into the course because prior CTECs that I read stated that too much work was packed into the tail end of the course. However, I think they did a great job incorporating that feedback into this quarter. The news packages were spaced apart nicely, and although putting them together took forever, I never felt overburdened. Outside of the news packages, there is not too much work, which is nice. I got a ton of constructive criticism and good feedback on my assignments, but grading is also very forgiving if you attend class and do all your work. It was nice to be able to focus more on improving my work rather than on worrying about improving my grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,Decent course but lecture is pretty useless
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is very easy, but that does not mean it is a productive class. Meeting the expectations for the class is doable but if you are expecting to come out of this class as a strong editor and videojournalist, you will be disappointed. More classes in that field will be required."
,,,,,,,,,,,I enjoyed the course a lot because I wanted to learn how to edit videos.
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Ward did an excellent job stimulating interest in this subject while engaging students to learn basic skills and techniques for journalism. She was enthusiastic and passionate about sharing knowledge and organized helpful lectures that allowed students to gain more knowledge about the subject. I thoroughly enjoyed the presentations and in–person activities that allowed students to put the knowledge they learned in practice.
,,,,,,,,,,,"i found this class to be a bit less challenging than 201–1. they're both similar amounts of work, but 201–2 is more concentrated spurts rather than consistent work. the average time spent outside of class is less than 201–1, but expect to spend 5+ hours editing each news package if you are new to adobe premiere. overall, a relatively easy class if you take the time to edit your packages well"
,,,,,,,,,,,"You have to take this for Medill, but it really doesn't teach you much. A few of the guest speakers are interesting if they work in fields that you're interested, but most of the class is redundant and doesn't require your attention. It's super easy, though"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This lecture is the biggest waste of time. Oh well, just use it to go through your email and twitter"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is pretty easy and helped me learn the basics of video editing. I had no previous exposure to video so this was a helpful starting point. I think the 5:00 PM news package structure can be slightly outdated, but I learned a lot and I would recommend the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Lectures in the course were simple, it was often pretty basic information and most of the new things we learned were pretty obvious. I don't really have any complaints about the course, but I also definitely wouldn't call it life–changing either. The concepts were reasonably simple and understandable, and near the end of the course they honestly started to feel unnecessary. However, it's clear that the professors know what they're talking about and they're always able to provide help if you need it. Of the two 201 classes, this is definitely the easier one."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, I think this class was very challenging to do within one quarter. We really had to learn as we went, and I think there were times when we would learn skills in lecture or lab later in the quarter when it would've been more beneficial to have learned before we had to submit our first news package. The main assignments for this course came down to three main news packages and participation in lab. Other exercises/assignment we had were graded for completion."
,,,,,,,,,,,"201–2 is far more manageable than 201–1 in terms of workload. You will do fine in this even if you have no experience in video journalism. I can't say it provides you with a great framework for learning the skills you'll need, though."
jour,jour,203,fall,Kalyani Chadha,4.80,4.17,3.73,3.51,4.28,4.32,"It's easy. The content is interesting but a lot of it feels unnecessary and drawn out. Lectures could be really boring, but labs were fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,The workload was not too bad at all. I found the lectures to be okay. Some of the guest speakers were very interesting. It is not difficult to do well as long as you turn in work on time and put effort into it.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very disappointing, disorganized class. I agree with all the previous CTEC comments: the contents are important but could be done in one single lecture; lectures and discussion sessions are disconnected; I'm writing the reflection papers with my previous knowledge in high school, nothing from what I learned in lectures. This class made me constantly doubt whether I want to do journalism at Medill because if this has always been the introductory class (according to the last four or five years' CTEC, they barely changed the course) of the best journalism school in the country, I don't really see future for journalism."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is really centered around the readings. As long as you have a strong understanding of the readings, you should be fine for the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall it was fine. The reading quizzes were fair and the attendance quizzes were easy some of the readings were good and informative but a lot were redundant. Hopefully, it will get better and more hands–on but this class was not terrible."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Chadha is a good lecturer. She provides useful insight on the topics and is an engaging lecturer. The individual lecture topics were all interesting in their own way, and I enjoyed that the class covered a multitude of problems we encounter in journalism. The reading quizzes are a little more difficult than anticipated but otherwise it is not too difficult."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Similarly, although the class was insightful, it was a bit repetitive."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was extremely helpful in understanding the values and tenets of journalism. Through posing relevant ethical questions and dilemmas present in the practice today, I was better able to understand the mission and duty of journalists today. However, while the discussion sections for this class were very good, I found that lecture could often be boring and simply cover material already assigned in the readings."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was an interesting course but somewhat dull considering there was no actual reporting being done. That being said, the work load was very manageable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was really interesting, and I’m really happy i took it"
,,,,,,,,,,,"As an intro class, it was good to learn about different theories and strategies for journalism. The one thing I wish we did more of was practice using those skills in class."
,,,,,,,,,,,The readings were very interesting for the class and the reading quizzes we'd have were easy and not made to trick you. I think the readings are the most important and Professor Chadha was sort of mediating factor to make sense of what we read.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Obviously, don't take this course if you're not a journalism major. Even as a journalism major, it was not the most interesting. The workload is manageable and the lectures are engaging enough."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures were often repetitive, but sometimes they were interesting. I found that they typically felt very long, and longer than my other lectures. The guest speakers varied a lot, and were sometimes really good but sometimes a little boring. For a required course, it was fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a lot of fun, it was really cool seeing how journalism and the practices surrounding it evolved over time. This was not a difficult class, just pay attention in lecture and read what's assigned and you should be fine. There were only 5 assignments and all them were manageable papers, but the teachers were also super helpful when it came to writing tips. If you're interested in journalism, this is the class for you."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was overall a rather boring course that made me doubt my interest in journalism, but it still established many interesting ideas and connections in understanding journalism's role in contemporary society. Other CTECs said the concepts became repetitive quickly, which made the course boring, but I would say that the some of the ideas presented were quite eye–opening, just the readings and lectures were presented quite dully."
,,,,,,,,,,,I learned a lot about the main motives of journalism and approaches to achieving these motives.
,,,,,,,,,,,"What stood out to me the most about this course was how interactive it was—there were always chances to offer your thoughts, answer questions, or post something on Poll Everywhere. This definitely helps with imagining how I would conduct myself as a journalist in a professional setting."
,,,,,,,,,,,I found myself engaged with the speakers during lecture and with the students during discussion sections
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Chadha has her slides well–put together and is a decent lecturer. She's a very friendly and awesome person when you drop by her office hours. I like how the take–home quizzes reflect the materials we read. This class's theorizing about what it means to tell the truth, be objective, etc. might be interesting to another person, but while I understood the concepts, I don't exactly think a whole quarter is necessary to cover everything we talked about."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very repetitive and subjective. Never seems to come to any real conclusions about anything, which makes it hard to stay engaged in."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, the class was not too difficult. Decently engaging but a bit repetitive. Good intro to Medill class, but could have introduced more variety. Kovach and Rosenstiel book could have been summarized in a paragraph, but the message was important. The reading quizzes were a bit difficult and detailed but easy to get the hang up. I understand that a version of this class is neccessary for a Medill students and, overall, this one did a decent job."
,,,,,,,,,,,I was underwhelmed by this course. I was often bored and didn't feel very satisfied with how I spent my time in/around the class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"It is a good review of ethics and basics but if you have any experience with journalism at a higher level than a high school club/organization, this is going to be a really easy course for you. I enjoyed hearing from my peers and instructors, who were really great, but the class overall was very very simple and down to the basics."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was so easy... almost too easy... I feel like I learned basically nothing, it's really just a requirement for the major to ensure that you understand ethics. The class wasn't hard or strenuous, it was just pointless. Honestly, if it was necessary, the content of this whole course could be covered in a week fairly effectively. This is no one's fault, the curriculum is just extremely flawed."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As someone who doesn't want to go into news journalism, I feel like this course didn't really cater to my career interests. It was all about providing an ethical basis to journalism, and I feel like it really mostly focused on traditional news journalism. It didn't go too into depth onto arts, culture, or sports journalism. The best part of this course was the different guest speakers introduced during lectures. I found the Knight Lab speaker series, especially, very effective at introducing non–traditional career paths."
,,,,,,,,,,,I enjoyed the lecture they were interesting and enjoyable.
,,,,,,,,,,,I was a little disappointed with the course especially with it being my introduction to Medill. The lectures were not stimulating at all and they felt repetitive for three weeks straight. I will say all of the guest speakers I throughouly enjoyed and gave me a bit of hope for Medill.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Sometimes it felt like the reading quizzes covered so many readings, but overall there wasn't much work and the work we did have was pretty organized and understandable. I enjoyed this class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a pretty straightforward class and a nice introduction to journalism ethics. It does feel a bit repetitive at times, though. However, the guest lecturers provided some nuance to the topics we were discussing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures and readings were the exact same, so class was incredibly repetitive. Discussion sections were more interesting when we did interviewing or writing activities, but half the time we just discussed material from the lectures, which was really redundant since we had already read and listened to the topics earlier in the week."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was fairly straightforward. It was not the most interesting, but it talked about some pretty relevant current news issues."
,,,,,,,,,,,The readings were interesting but the lectures just went over what was said in the readings. I didn't feel that I learned much in this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I did not find the Monday lectures very engaging. I don't think it was really Professor Chadha's fault but more so just the nature of the course. While it was at times boring and repetitive, the workload was very manageable and I never really felt stressed over this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is super boring but not awful. The weekly readings are time consuming and the corresponding reading quizzes test you on pretty detailed and obscure information. The class isn't really that hard though and Newsroom 101 teaches you about AP style pretty well. Just be aware that this class is very repetitive and basically discusses facets of truth all quarter.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, it was nice to have an introduction to journalism with Professor Chadha – she was very engaging and tried to facilitate participation as best she could. However, since most of lecture was the presentation of slides and less interactive options, I definitely learned more in discussion sections."
,,,,,,,,,,,"For an introductory course, it was pretty good. slow in the beginning but picks up quickly – especially when we started getting a bunch of guest speakers. Professor Kalyani is a great lecturer. But it’s important to know that she does almost none of your grading as that is left for the lab professor. So you really only see her in lecture."
,,,,,,,,,,,It was a really chill class; I'm definitely more prepared for the journalism courses following this one.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures are pretty boring at times and can be repetitive of the readings. However, the guest speakers are very interesting and there are some nuggets of wisdom that come out of them. Moreover, it's very interesting to hear from all of the different professors who are established professionals in the field of journalism."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was pretty boring but easy. It did bring up interesting ideas about journalism, ethics, and values, but failed to do so in an interesting manner. The lectures felt like regurgitations of the readings and discussions were mostly filled with pointless exercises that didn't really feel like they focused on the content on the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think it's a good strategy to have first year students take this class first. The class isn't very stressful, and it isn't a ton of work. It will seem a bit boring at times, but it isn't a total snoozer. If you are interested in journalism, even though it's a bit of an introduction class, it's still a journalism class. You will be engaged in the material a fair amount."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures were somewhat repetitive of the required readings. Readings were interesting and stimulating, and the weekly reading quizzes are fair."
,,,,,,,,,,,The course was pretty useless. I understand its goal was mostly in informing us of journalistic theory and philosophy. But the lack of actual education on reporting skills was disappointing. It was quite boring and made it tough to stay engaged.
,,,,,,,,,,,"How good this class is really depends on which professor you get. It's really not a lot of work, but you'll be thankful for that your first quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course helped me learn a lot about the theory behind journalism, but it mostly was just recap on everything that we were assigned for homework."
,,,,,,,,,,,Very engaging and concepts are easy to grasp. It was a smooth transition into the journalism major!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Much of the lecture content was too theoretical, though it's hard to not keep saying ""it depends"" when talking about journalistic ethics and practices. The course provides some good historical context for American journalism, and Professor Chadha is a very knowledgeable professor who explains complex topics well, so ask her lots of questions. To balance out the first–year Medill sequence, I think this introduction class should focus on the information–gathering side of reporting – interviews, investigation techniques, etc. – and weave addendums about objectivity, accuracy, and diverse coverage into those skills. Currently, it feels the other way around, so some of the newswriting exercises we've done in lab seem out of place, and people don't feel as prepared as they could feel for 201–1 and 201–2."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Class is a requirement, so it's a little bit of a drag but you'll get through it either way."
,,,,,,,,,,,The class was interesting in theory. It did not involve much on the weaky base and is pretty discussion based. You don't really do any hardcore journalism or learning of techniques.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Chadha is a very nice and interesting professor, but I think these lectures fall short because of the course content. When you've already learned a majority of the content you're learning in class because the mandatory readings already covered a the content, the lectures lose their interest. If you're in Medill you have to take this course, so it's easy in that regard, but if you're experienced, don't expect to learn a whole lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is important if it's not the most interesting course you will take. Professor Chadha is a really good lecturer, and she is good at engaging with students."
,,,,,,,,,,,"202 was a great intro class into Medill, as it allows you to understand ""why journalism"" before actually entering the realm of learning it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Even though I didn't come in which much journalism experience, I found most of this course's content to be redundant and basic. The Kovach and Rosenstiel book nailed down the same points several times and the lectures were verbatim the readings."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Chadha is a good lecturer and a nice person, and all the lab professors are good. This course is not difficult and the lab time is not stressful. Everyone will do fine in this class if you just do the reading quizzes and the reflection papers on time"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was interesting, as we mainly explored objectivity and its alternatives; however, be ready to learn the same things in lectures, readings, and labs. It was good to learn about, but the instruction could have been a little less redundant. Aside from weekly readings, there was a reading quiz, newsroom 101 (AP style) quizzes, 4 short reflection papers, and then a final paper. Not too bad, but it might not be your absolute favorite class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Chadha is an amazing person and is extremely knowledgable on the topics discussed. She does a good job of getting student participation in lecture through PollEverywhere and other questions. That said, lecture at times was very boring just based on the material discussed and I found myself zoning out at times. You don't really have to pay attention in lecture to do well in this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"At times, the big lecture was boring and hard to sit through, but I enjoyed the guest speakers/lecturers who would offer their personal experiences. Sometimes, the lecture notes would come directly from the readings we had for that week."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Lectures are quite interesting, and I especially loved lectures featuring guest speakers. The concepts we learned in class are also supported by many examples from the real world. The readings from the textbook were a little repetitive sometimes, but overall, the course itself was sparked my interest."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lecture portion of this course is interesting, but moves so slowly and is extremely repetitive. Readings are interesting, but the lecture often just regurgitates what we read in the weekly readings/reading quiz. This course felt almost demeaning because of how slow it was– very much so a review of practices I already learned in my high school journalism experience."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was very boring and not helpful. There is not a ton of work to do but some of the material did not make a ton of sense and it did not seem like there was a pattern to what was being taught.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think this course is not as helpful as it sets out to be. I found it to be very repetitive. Also, many of the conversations we had involved convoluted questions that really had no answer, so they kind of seemed pointless to debate. I learned a lot more from lab than lecture, which seemed disorganized at times. I think most, if not everyone, had some sort of familiarity with journalism or had newspaper experience, so it was sort of a very basic foundations class. But again, the topics we discussed did not really allow us to draw specific conclusions that would be useful for future work in the field."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was excellent during this quarter. There are lectures once a week with a short true or false attendance quiz at each lecture, reading quizzes due before each lecture, and certain sets of reading that need to be done prior to a lecture. The workload was manageable and the lectures were very engaging. I highly enjoyed this class and recommend it to anyone interested in journalism."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Reading and attendance quizzes were simple, engaging and inviting lectures, readings were dull at times"
,,,,,,,,,,,I thought the best parts of this course was the historical background it gave to journalism.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a very good introduction to journalism course. Some assignments felt unnecessarily lengthy, but the lectures and labs were very engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is a requirement and not incredibly difficult but it is often boring and repetitive.
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was a nice course, and I'm glad they eased us into the field instead of plunging us in. It's good to have a bigger picture perspective on the field before getting into our niches. The course did drag on a little bit though, and lacked enthusiasm at times. I just got the sense that this wasn't a course any of the professors were excited to teach, as it really does just touch on very general and aspirational stuff. There's some complexity in the debates on topics like advocacy or objectivity, but I feel like the course stopped short of doing really deep and interesting dives. Some of the readings were cool, although many were quite dull. Especially Kovach and Rosenstiel; I understand they articulate things well, but they are just incredibly conceited and heavy–handed. Finally, I liked some of the audience engagement and multi–media stuff. It's important to mix up the way information is presented to us in long lectures like that."
,,,,,,,,,,,"For a required Medill course, it was as good as it could be. Prof. Chadha has a clear passion for the subject and does a great job of communicating that passion to students. The opportunity to fill out a weekly lecture/lab review and ample office hour opportunity to communicate with the lead lecturer about the course allowed you to feel heard in a very large class (all of the Medill first–years)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Course was easy. Readings were usually interesting, not too long (with the exception of the Kovach/Rosenstiel textbook, which usually droned on unnecessarily). Reading quizzes, attendance quizzes, reflection papers, and Newsroom101 assignments seemed like busywork at times but I didn't mind them as a break from some of my other, more rigorous courses."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Come to lecture, do the assignments on time, talk to the lead lecturer about what interests you, and it's a great introduction to Medill."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a breeze. Some of the readings were interesting, others were average. Prof. Chadha is a great lecturer."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Lecture could be a bit tedious (and slightly repetitive considering it was often a reiteration of the week’s assigned readings), but I genuinely enjoyed all Prof. Chadha taught and absolutely adored “The Elements of Journalism” – so much so that I intend to finish the novel on my own time. Prior to my first quarter at Northwestern, much of what I knew about journalism pertained exclusively to the writing aspect; I enjoyed learning more about the practice itself and its inherent values in lecture."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall a fine lecture. Most of the time the lectures would be exactly what the readings were about and not very engaging, but all of the guest lecturers who came were very interesting and cool to learn from"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was not a fan of this course – much of the material was redundant and it felt like they were trying to stretch it out to fill the quarter. The topics were important to know/talk about, but. I don't think they made up a good course. There is little work – biweekly, short reflection papers, weekly reading and grammar assignments – but they could feel painful to do at times."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a good introductory course for first–year students in Medill, because it is low–stress and not too difficult. The lectures can be boring at times and the readings can be tedious, but they gave me a basic understanding that will prepare me for the more complex Medill courses in the future."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was very helpful in building my journalistic foundation as well as getting to know other Medill students. Prof. Chadha is very sweet, but also informative."
,,,,,,,,,,,I wish that the lectures had been a bit more engaging and specific.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was easy. The first year sequence for Journalism kind of sucks and the lectures and discussions kind of made me want to drop out of Journalism. We sat in a hall for like 90 minutes basically reiterating what we already had a reading quiz on and then proceeded to do elementary activities and exams to reiterate what has been reiterated. I get that it's important, but it just felt unnecessary at times. Like a lecture about how not to make mistakes as a journalist because it looks poorly on your publication and spreads misinformation. It just felt really unnecessary to spend 90 minutes on that. I personally am someone who gets bored quite easily and annoyed. Wouldn't recommend unless you really want to be a journalist. Otherwise, go for it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Lectures were very informative and insightful, just wish there was more opportunity for engagement/idea sharing during it"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course was not one of the harder ones, and the workload outside of class was very manageable. It was repetitive at times, but it is definitely an important course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class frustrated me –– content warnings were not adequate when sensitive topics were discussed and objectivity was talked about for multiple weeks while inclusive and mindful reporting on diverse communities was only discussed for one lecture and half of a lab. The readings were too theoretical –– it would have been more interesting to read, listen to, or watch actual journalistic pieces that reflected the principles being discussed in lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was an interesting introduction to Medill. We went through a lot of theory about journalism and generally found that there was no real answer; everything seemed subjective which was frustrating. I wish there was more structure for the course that was supposed to introduce us to journalism. The lectures however were very interesting; save for maybe a couple here and there they were really engaging and Professor Chadha is a really amazing lecturer.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I felt that the course content was extremely repetitive and simplistic. It didn't have enough emphasis on real–world situations, and I would have appreciated a more complex exploration of journalistic ethics with more concrete examples. I know this is a requirement, so you don't have much choice, but just know that it doesn't take very much effort to do well. (Which, as a journalism major, is disappointing.)"
,,,,,,,,,,,Sometimes lab assignments felt a little random. They didn't always tie into lecture content in a helpful manner.
,,,,,,,,,,,I thought lede practice and discussion were the most important aspects that facilitated my learning in this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a pretty standard lecture class but i was disappointed that with each week, i lost more and more interest in what we covered. there are readings assigned each week before lecture as well as quizzes, but they were rarely discussed during lecture and it honestly felt like a waste of time to read. lecture was always the same few people raising their hands to answer Prof. Chadha's questions because it felt like no one was really fully engaged, and the the answers given were never really unpacked afterwards either. Overall did not enjoy the lecture aspect of this class and wished there was more effort put in to making it a more engaging intro course"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed lectures because of the variety of topics we learned about. The Knight Lab has been one of the opportunities I am hoping to be more involved with in the future, but that I had yet to make more time to learn about, so it was really great when the coordinators of the Knight Lab came as a guest speakers too."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed the lectures. A 5–min break in between may have made it less tiring at the end of the day, but overall interesting work covered. The work we do is related to the course and the lectures were interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I get a bit stressed listening to Professor Chadha lecture. She is organized in terms of her slideshows and content, but her delivery is slightly frantic and nervous. In terms of the content, the lectures were fairly interesting but got a bit repetitive at times. The Kovach and Rosenstiel readings were probably my least favorite part of the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Readings were pretty interesting and were very insightful. It could get a little repetitive in lecture if you've already completed the readings, though."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I didn't feel that the course was a particularly good introduction to the journalism program at Northwestern. I didn't find it particularly interesting or engaging, although I felt it had the potential to be with better organization. Not a bad class but it focused much less on journalism practice than values and not very indicative of the rest of Medill classes that you will take."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was very manageable and allowed us all to ease into journalism without being overwhelmed. I really appreciated learning about objectivity its nuances. At times this course felt almost too easy, so much so I got bored. The lectures weren't always the most engaging, but I enjoyed several of the speakers. That being said, however, this is an introductory level course, so I am satisfied with what I learned."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I definitely learned some important concepts related to journalistic ethics, but the lectures weren't very engaging and the readings were very confusing at times."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was okay. I enjoyed thinking about questions in the practice of journalism, but I would also say the class did not offer a lot of concrete answers. The class has reading assignments and reading quizzes, reflection papers, in–class assignments and a final paper. The class isn’t difficult and I think Professor Chadha is a good lecturer. The content can just be repetitive and ambiguous."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I wasted so many hours in that lecture room. I can't really think of anything that we learned in this class. And, to make it worse, there were so many cringe moments too; From the transphobic drunk history video to Professor Chadha using an image of lynchings as an aesthetic choice on her slides, there was as least one moment per class that made you raise you eyebrow. At least those moments were interesting, even if it was in the worst way. The rest of the class…man, it was a real sleeper."
jour,jour,301,fall,Arionne Nettles,5.60,4.90,4.50,3.50,5.30,3.89,"Especially as a student with not much prior experience with audio, this course really inspired me to want to dive deeper into audio journalism! Assignments didn't feel like homework at all, and you have so much freedom in regards to your reporting process and story development. This class allows you to really hone in on the ""practice"" of journalism, since every story is your pitch (with only logistical and structure guidelines/advice)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Nettles is an angel! She is genuinely interested in helping all of her students succeed not only at Medill, but also in their careers. This class is essentially a trial ""newsroom"" for audio reporting, and you will definitely get out of it what you put in. I would highly, highly recommend taking this class or any of Professor Nettles' other classes!"
,,,,,,,,,,,pretty chill
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really loved this class! I was already really interested in audio, but being able to explore story ideas on my own only made me love it more! It's a lot like a reporting and writing class like 201–1, but there is definitely more free rein and personal responsibility."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was really excited about taking this class since it had everything I was looking for. Nettles is a great person who really cares about helping students. That being said, it was super obvious that this was the first time this class was being taught. Assignments were a little all over the place and nothing really came back to arts and culture in Chicago, which is what I was looking for. Seems like with a little more guidance it can be a really cool and interesting 301, but for now there's just not enough direction for the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Nettles is such an understanding professor who really wants her students to succeed. You will do a lot of hands–on work in this class, but the assignments were never overwhelming. Audio storytelling is really fun and I'm glad to have gotten an introduction to the form."
,,,,,,,,,,,This has been my favorite medill class I've ever been in. We got professional audio equipment for the quarter and were given free range over 3 different assignments. Professor Nettles is the sweetest most understanding and helpful medill professor I've ever come across she is so understanding and supportive in helping us grow and improve at audio reporting and journalism. And we got to see a live recording of a podcast as a field trip which was super cool! This is definitely not a class that will have you stressed about your stories as we get ample time for assignments and helpful comments and feedback before turning in it. i cannot recommend this class & any class w professor Nettles enough!!
jour,jour,301,fall,Jeremy Gilbert,5.59,5.00,4.82,4.47,5.38,4.41,Great class. Course content aligned with my interests and made me curious to learn more about media business models and tech.
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof. Gilbert is really nice and his class gives you a great introduction to innovations in journalism. I wish the topic were a bit more varied as it felt like we were talking only about AI for the whole quarter.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was awesome. It was a great chance to bond with members of the Bay Area Immersion cohort as well as set a great foundation on media design and innovation. If you love entrepreneurship and innovation, take this course! You learn a lot about yourself in this space and it provides a great opportunity to grow. I also loved how many guest speakers from media companies come to speak with us because it is so applicable to the real world."
,,,,,,,,,,,"While I loved the prof, the content was pretty boring for me. I try to have a growth mindset about it, but I'm not really inclined naturally to be into tech and AI. For that reason, I didn't like it that much."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Gilbert is such a professional yet approachable person – you can tell he really knows a lot about his field and is always willing to help. He made this class exciting and it was a wonderful experience overall. I also really got to learn about how AI impacts media and most of the guest speakers were interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,Jeremy is amazing! he’s so nice and personable! The class is a little boring but overall helpful and fun. not a lot of work
,,,,,,,,,,,"The material was interesting, though not particularly challenging. It was a great introduction for the Bay Area Immersion program to give me an idea of the skills I will gain."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Gilbert is the GOAT. This class is a blast. Getting to meet the rest of the BAIP is super cool. Plus the class is chill. Minimal work. The class has long hours but we always end around 1 –1.5 hours early depending on the day. Guest speakers are brought in everyweek and are awe–inspiring (we got to talk to people from BBC, AP, NYT and founders like Trei brundrett)"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class and highly encourage anyone interested in AI and entrepreneurship to take it. During class time, several entrepreneurs spoke to our class, such as a VOX cofounder and numerous other intrepreneurs. The work that is assigned in this class is very interesting and accessible. Professor Gilbert was an excellent professor who made a sustained effort to make the class as interesting as possible."

jour,jour,301,fall,Karen Springen,5.91,5.82,5.60,5.70,6.00,7.36,I learned from this course to not let my nerves get the best of me when it comes to approaching big stories. I saw firsthand how the quality of the article really depends on the effort you put into your reporting.
,,,,,,,,,,,This was an awesome class. Karen is the best teacher. I discovered a newfound interest for magazine writing and magazines in this class. It was very interesting to hear from practicing journalists about their careers. They gave us incredible advice.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I love Professor Springen!!! Karen is an amazing professor and person. In Medill, professors who have a lot of experience in the industry can sometimes feel distant, even if they're not trying to be. There's a feeling of a certain expectation they have and that you're not able to meet it. This iwas NOT my experience for Karen. Professor Springen is so kind and understanding, flexible and WANTS YOU TO SUCCEED. I've never met a professor thus far who has been so eager to show and teach you so much for YOUR sake. In my opinion, the class is still too long. I feel like the content on the more lecture–y portions of the class got repetetive. Still, Karen's cookies make up for it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course because of the guest speakers. The course itself was very similar to reporting and writing, though, which I didn't enjoy as much. The guest speakers were definitely the highlight."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is a little intense because there is a lot of writing and reporting, but if you are interested in writing definitely take this class. Karen is amazing and is always willing to help outside of class. Also, the guest speakers are amazing and you get the chance to ask so many questions."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class. Karen is the best teacher I've had at NU. Great course, great times."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Springen made herself very available to students and her comments definitely improved the quality of my writing. She also brought in fantastic speakers from many different areas of journalism and I learned a lot from them as well.
jour,jour,301,fall,Stephan Garnett,5.18,5.09,5.00,5.18,5.45,7.00,"If you have the ability to take this class, DO IT. This has been by far the best journalism class I have taken at Northwestern. Garnett makes it clear off the bat that the point of the class is to get students out of Evanston and their comfort zones to be able to report in a big city. The project group you end up with makes a huge difference, since you'll spend a lot of time working with about three other people. The class almost never actually meets aside from presentations – the rest of the time, you're expected to travel into the neighborhoods you're studying to learn about gentrification and displacement. Not a lot of structure, but tons of creative freedom."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was a huge learning experience for me. I dont want to be a journalist after I graduate, and although this class taught me about journalism in practice, I learned extremely valuable life skills about education, politics, and race–dynamics. U only meet for class 3 times throughout the quarter and the rest is async work. Everyone told me not to procrastinate and I tried to listen but honestly everything kind of has to come together in the end. stayed up till 4am working before both presentations but SO WORTH IT. class taught me so much about the city of Chicago. In Evanston u often feel like you are in a bubble and its hard to get to know the city but this class really makes me feel I have a better understanding of where I have lived for the last 2 years and will live for another 2."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was an exercise in self discipline to stay on track in this class since we only met in–person three times throughout the quarter, but it was well–worth it. I met some great people in communities I've never been in and learned a lot about what field reporting looks like outside the safety of journalism school and the Northwestern community."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is an excellent 301–0 option for any Journalism student. It forces students outside of their comfort zone to cover communities they are unfamiliar with. The assignment load is overall pretty low, but I personally got a lot out of the work assigned."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is ENTIRELY unstructured. All class time is spent working with your group and going to Chicago. If this works for you you'll enjoy this course but if having literally zero instruction seems stressful to you maybe don't take this class. This is the last time he will teach it though!
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is the best class that I have taken at Northwestern. Steve did not hold our hand throughout the process which helped me learn how to approach a community and look for stories on my own. I learned to get over my fear of approaching people and a lot about how multiple areas of life impact gentrification.
,,,,,,,,,,,Don't be intimidated by how this class is scheduled!
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was very self–driven and I felt like I was unprepared, but this class is totally what you make of it. Stephan seems scary at first, but he's actually a softie."
,,,,,,,,,,,"A huge portion of this class is group work, so be wary for who you choose as your team and make sure you're on top of your stuff."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Luckily, I loved my group and we killed it on our projects so I actually really loved this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Please DO NOT procrastinate. Deadlines may seem very far away, but they will creep up on you and you will be scrambling to find sources. That being said, this class really gave me a taste of what being a real journalist would feel like. We were put in a position to do our own reporting and find our own stories. This class WILL put you out of your comfort zone and you will have to approach strangers and enter unfamiliar places. But ultimately, I ended up producing some satisfying work and it was worth it in the end."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good class, gave me more confidence in being able to network in a new community."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, this course definitely helped me gain very usable skills as a journalist. You're separated into groups and each have to report on a different aspect of the assigned neighborhoods. You only meet as a class like twice in the quarter, otherwise you're just out reporting. I did learn a lot because you're basically just a working journalist in this class, but it can be kind of difficult as a full–time student to be a working journalist at the same time, especially with the time it takes to get all over the city of Chicago during a school week. But that aside it definitely reignited my love for journalism and helped me produce some really interesting pieces that I'm proud of! A great opportunity to learn about the area beyond Evanston."
jour,jour,301,winter,Peter Slevin,5.89,5.78,5.89,5.56,5.78,7.44,This class si really interesting and will give you lots of reporting practice. It's a little intense at time since there's always a story to be working on but professor Slevin is really helpful and a great professor.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was incredibly informative. The combination of instruction, class discussion, assignments, and guest speakers ensured that everyone in the class truly understood the concepts of the topics this class covers. We dove deep into current issues, and it really opened my eyes to the city around us. Because of this class, I feel more at home in Evanston, and am able to better critically analyze events around me."
,,,,,,,,,,,"A really interesting class that exposes you to Evanston – you learn very quickly what you think you know about the city and what you actually know about it are very different. Expect to be going further for sources – no students allowed! You really have to get off campus and do the ""Shoe leather"" reporting on some tough, but meaningful topics."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class with Professor Slevin was amazing!! He is the best professor I've had so far in Medill and the topics we talked about and covered in this class were very interesting and made me really excited to report on them!
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is great. Covers a difficult topic in very accessible, yet thorough way. The discussions were fantastic and the assignments were not overwhelming. No tests or exams and just a final project"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really great Medill class, you get so much out of it. I went in not knowing much about Evanston, and I feel like I am way more informed and involved in the Evanston community now. Professor Slevin is an incredible professor. Even though the class is long, he keeps it interesting and engaging the whole time."
jour,jour,301,winter,Mei-Ling Hopgood,5.10,5.40,5.20,4.90,5.33,8.20,Probably the best Medill class I've taken so far. Professor Hopgood is the absolute best and makes sure you learn the material. Absolutely recommend
,,,,,,,,,,,nothing worse than 9 ams
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really liked this course! Hopgood is a great prof and has excellent advice and feedback. There are plenty of opportunities to write, which I loved, and lots of freedom."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course will teach you so much about how to build genuine relationships with sources. I feel like I will keep in touch with many of the people I spoke with for these assignments. Class time is a LOT of guest speakers and reworking drafts of stories you're writing. But the actual stories you write are super rewarding. Prof. Mei–Ling graded assignments complete/non–complete which took a lot of stress off the typical 301. You could get pluses for really good work, and I liked that structure a lot. Still made me super motivated to try hard at the class, just for the right reasons (not just grades)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was amazing, Prof. Hopgood really puts in so much effort and care in her responses and edits. The class, for a reporting class, has minimal official articles; instead, it is much more focused on taking a step back and working through the reporting process as well as learning to report on marginalized communities and building relationships with locals. Definitely the best Medill class I have taken so far!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really enjoyed this class. It gave me a chance to do some bilingual reporting and make connections within my own community. Lots of work to report, but you get what you put into it. I am really proud of all that I accomplished this Q with my reporting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"While the class places an emphasis on reporting about Asian Americans, the stories do not necessarily focus heavily on identity. This allowed for the freedom to report on a wide range of topics while learning about journalism surrounding Asian American. The workload is similar to that of JOUR 201–1, but the completion–based grading system reduces the stress that comes with a reporting class."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was fine for a JOUR 301 course and many of the assignments were engaging and fun to complete.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class overall. The assignments were very doable but also interesting, and we could take them in directions that we were most interested in. The work isn't overwhelming at all unless you wait to the last minute to start reporting. Prof. Hopgood brought in some very cool guest speakers. She'd also regularly give us reporting days instead of having us come to class, which was lovely."
jour,jour,301,spring,Craig Duff,5.67,5.56,5.44,5.44,5.56,10.11,"I felt like the workload was manageable for this class with small assignments each week and two larger projects. If you prepare ahead of time, the edits are very easy."
,,,,,,,,,,,I gained a much better understanding of how to use premiere pro as well as some good tips to carry with me about filming video.
,,,,,,,,,,,"professor duff structured this course in a great way. equal time was spent learning how to edit in premiere pro and learning how to use cameras. the cameras are pretty scary to use at first (especially if you're new to film) but I felt pretty confident by the end of the course. the workload was pretty heavy though, but it takes a lot to learn video journalism, so i thought it was well worth it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was incredible, and one of the most worthwhile ones I have taken at Northwestern. We published stories for the Roundtable which was really cool, and it incorporated all elements of documentary storytelling (camera work, editing, writing for video etc). However, I will say it was a huge time commitment with a lot of class assignments as well as reporting outside of class. So if you are not super passionate about video reporting I would not recommend taking it. Also the camera equipment was pretty technical and hard to work/carry around everywhere––– so you definitely have to be passionate."
,,,,,,,,,,,Amazing. Take this course if you can! You learn to use a professional video camera and do two projects one on–campus by yourself and a final project with your partner. I loved the instruction and the course was very organized.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Duff's experience in video reporting really helped us learn more in lectures. Not only does he emphasize shooting, but also editing. This really helped me build skills on how to report through video from A–Z. The only drawback I would say is that this course deserves more class time than a quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The overall structure of the course was excellent, and I really gained confidence with the camera equipment and learned a lot. The lectures were sometimes pretty boring and are extremely long."
,,,,,,,,,,,Always overestimate how long it will take to edit something. Underestimating will have you up at 3 am crying over a graphic. Make sure you always make plenty of time and always shoot a TON of b–roll.
jour,jour,301,spring,Jon Marshall,5.83,5.69,5.31,5.23,5.69,7.31,"All the guest speakers and field trips were super fascinating and intellectually engaging and helped me feel more connected to the city I was reporting on. J Marsh gave us great resources like links, websites, advice, and examples for us to follow and use to create our best work, and he really cared about us as students."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Easily the best Medill class I've taken so far. The flexibility Prof. Marshall gave in terms of choosing what to do with the final project was nice –– that helped make it feel more like a personal project than a class one. As someone who hadn't explored outside of downtown Chicago as much before this, I found the trips to different neighborhoods awesome. Even if you're not interested in reporting professionally, this is a fantastic class that can be really fulfilling"
,,,,,,,,,,,TAKE 301 WITH JMARSH!!!! He is so kind and invested in his student's success. The field trips are so fun and you actually learn a lot from them. Workload is very manageable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Marshall is the best. Take this class if you can, it can be a fairly decent amount of work but overall it is so much fun and engaging. Best class I have taken at Northwestern for sure."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Jon Marshall is the GOAT. He is one of the only genuinely kind and helpful Medill profs. The workload is manageable, and he is pretty flexible if you communicate. The class focuses on sports but also Chicago as a whole. The structure is kind of wonky, with erratic field trips that have zero relevance to what we learned in class, but it's the best 301 class by far for someone who is or is not a sports fan. If you can, enroll in this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I had a really good experience in this class. This section had such a unique focus that really helped the intensive reporting feel easier. Professor Marshall is exceptional and while his grading can be harsh at times, it usually comes with justification and with the intention of making you the best writer you can be. I feel like I really connected with my classmates and learned so much about Chicago. Learning about the city's baseball rivalry and history while simultaneously seeing Chicago communities and how racial and economical elements factor into everything was incredibly interesting. The readings JMarsh selected were really interesting and I never felt the need to skim or get a summary because I genuinely wanted to read them. Take this class!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Take advantage of office hours.
,,,,,,,,,,,I love JMarsh and this class was challenging for me but very rewarding.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Don't be fearful if you're not the biggest sports person. This class had more of a focus on Chicago and taught me so much about its history and neighborhoods. You get the opportunity to go on plenty of field trips around the city, and then for your final project you really get to take your reporting any direction you choose. This is a great class and J Marsh is amazing!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"for a medill class, this was a solid course. better than any of the other 301's. Professor Marshall is a nice professor who is very knowledgeable about the city. while some of the classes feel like review over info from 201–1 and 201–2, overall the classes were good. workload is reasonable. class field trips were fun."
,,,,,,,,,,,"JMarsh is a super conscientious professor and made this class fun and interesting, though it seemed like a bit more work compared to other 301 sections. I enjoyed it, grading is pretty harsh but you do improve a lot"
,,,,,,,,,,,"If J–Marsh is teaching a course at Northwestern, you take it. If he's teaching a 301 class about baseball and Chicago, you pre–reg for it and flush ice cubes down the toilet to hope that you get in. He is the best professor I've had at NU (Medill or other), and he cares so much about his students. The variety we had in this course was incredible. In addition to weekly readings, we had field trips to different neighborhoods in Chicago to meet with communication reps, alderpersons, etc. We also had innumerable opportunities to do on–site reporting and learn about the city while practicing journalism. The final project is an in–depth story (you choose the medium) about a topic of your choice, and although it's challenging, the feedback that Professor Marshall gave throughout the process was amazing. TAKE THIS CLASS! I CAN'T STRESS IT ENOUGH!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"A fantastic 301 class. JMarsh is awesome and really cares about all of his students. We went on a lot of fun field trips into the city and saw a lot of different neighborhoods. Even though the class is technically about the Cubs/White Sox, you don't have to be interested in baseball or even sports to get a lot out of the class. It's more about the North/South divide and the general city attitudes than it is about sports. Grading is based on Flipgrid video responses to weekly readings, some different writing assignments throughout the quarter, and a final project. You can basically write about anything you want for the final, as long as it relates to Chicago, and JMarsh gives a lot of class time to go into the city and report, so it's very manageable. Overall, great class and JMarsh is the best!"
jour,jour,301,spring,Louise Kiernan,5.83,5.58,5.42,5.50,5.83,4.42,"This was a really interesting class, and prof. Kiernan is a great professor. We went on two field trips during class into Chicago, which were both really interesting and related to the rest of the course work we had to do. The main assignment for the class is an enterprise story where you choose a topic and write a story on it. This was difficult because all of the sources and story had to be based in Chicago, which made it difficult to get in contact with people sometimes, but it was a great class that definitely takes you out of your comfort zone."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Kiernan is really a great professor and you will be very lucky if you have her as your 301 professor. She is very detailed, very organized and offers great feedback. The class isn't too difficult but is just right. Really challenges you to step outside of your comfort zone but you'll be very happy at the end of the course!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR KIERNAN! She is so amazing. She pushes you but is very understanding and kind and she really knows her stuff! I came into this class really not wanting to take it, but I am so so glad that I did. I learned so much and remembered why I love journalism."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVED this course!! TAKE A COURSE WITH PROF. KIERNAN IF YOU CAN! I’ve learned more in this course than in any other Medill course. In fact, this course made me realize that I want to become a features writer or investigative reporter. The only major assignment for this class was an enterprise story, and we had lots of guidance and flexibility. Prof. Kiernan is a great teacher and generally wants her students to succeed. I would take this class all over again if I could."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Kiernan is the one of the first Medill professors I've had that treated students like humans instead of content–producing machines. She had an amazing pulse of the class and when took ample class to answer our questions and address our concerns. And when she sensed that the class was getting overwhelming, instead of just chugging along and telling us to push through, she lightened our load, which was amazing. She also has a grading system based on check–pluses, checks, and check–minuses, which really encouraged me to take risks. If you have some journalism experience at a campus publication, you probably won't learn a lot of technique in this class, but the chance to go into Chicago and report on issues is AMAZING and unforgettable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"When you see a class with Prof. Kiernan –– TAKE IT!!! She is hands down one of my favorite professors and taking 301 with her is amazing. This class had trips to Chicago which were really cool, and lots of time for working on articles during class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Ah, the class that will make you fall in love with journalism again! Do whatever you can to take a class with Prof. Kiernan at some point in your Medill experience. She builds a relationship with each student and becomes intimately knowledgeable about their article and its process. She is fair and approachable. Somehow she managed to make a 5–hour class period not HORRIBLE with amazing field trips and engaging class discussions! I learned more about journalism ethics/theory in this class than I did in the entire first–year Medill sequence. Though we were all nervous about reporting on Chicago communities going into the class, we all ended up taking incredible risks and developed stories to be proud of. Added bonus – this class will make you fall in love with Chicago too!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Kiernan is AWESOME! She is so thoughtful, kind, intelligent, and passionate about journalism. She also had such a cool and impactful career. So, I was slightly dreading taking 301 because I heard it was a lot of work, but I ended up loving this class. All the field trips were incredible, the lectures were interesting, and reporting assignments were valuable. I feel like I learned so much about journalism in this class, Chicago, and built up my skills. 10/10 would recommend –– incredible 301. Not too much work, but a good amount that you still learn and are challenged. I also like how we had drafts for our final story throughout the quarter to receive feedback; super helpful!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Kiernan is amazing; she's very understanding, flexible and genuinely cares for her students. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I signed up for this 301, but I'd definitely recommend it. There are few actual stories with heavy emphasis on the final enterprise story, but still several chances to learn more about Chicago through field trips and class discussions."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is an excellent course. It's so interesting to learn about Chicago through the site visits, your own reporting and learning about your classmates' reporting. Professor Kiernan did a fantastic job at teaching us about many different aspects of the city. The class had the perfect mixture of in–class instruction and hands–on experience, so I never felt I was diving into an assignment unprepared. I learned so much in this class and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it!"

It's definitely not easy though. You will be traveling to the city a lot, and it can be difficult to get in contact with sources. I recommend starting early because it's really rough at the end of the quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The experiential dynamic of this course is unlike most other journalism courses at Northwestern. I got the chance to write real stories about real communities, while learning about important urban trends like gentrification."
,,,,,,,,,,,Such a great class with lots of learning experiences. Organize your time well and choose your group well to minimize stress. Prof. Garnett is absolutely amazing and brings so much experience to every class (even though we only meet 3x throughout the quarter). You will get out what you put in!
,,,,,,,,,,,"AMAZING class. Everyone loves Steve. The format of individual and group reporting was very rewarding, and I learned a ton about Lakeview/Uptown and gentrification. Super amazing class to develop reporting skills and knowledge on specific topics like education. Super rewarding to create the projects."
,,,,,,,,,,,There are only three class meeting and all other scheduled class time is to go do your own research and reporting. I love this.
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was important for me to have time in this course to report in Chicago, and the professor gave us ample time to do so in this class which made it more accessible."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class only met about 4 times total. There was a report and a presentation, a package of news stories and a presentation, and an individual feature story. Professor Garnett was the best."
jour,jour,301,spring,Jessica Villagomez,4.80,4.80,4.00,4.20,4.80,7.00,"Professor Villagomez was helpful during the course, but during most of it it felt like we were just doing everything alone with no guidance as to how to complete assignments"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class as a whole was great and all of the assignments built up to the final story, which I appreciated. However, for the second half of the course, it felt like there was very little support in helping us actually complete our story, so it made the process of finishing the final stories a lot more arduous than it needed to be. But overall, a great pick for the 301 requirement and Prof. Villagomez is very willing to help if you come to her with concerns."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a great way to fulfill the 301 requirement! You only write one story which is your final project, and all of the assignments along the way set you up to write the story (interview assignment, source list, story pitch, etc). As long as you keep up with everything along the way, it's not a lot of work at all. Villagomez is a great instructor and wants students to write about things they are actually interested in."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm not a big fan of reporting, so I wasn't super excited to take this class in the first place, and while it was nice to be able to take a deep dive into a topic I was interested in with the possibly of making a difference, I can't say I'd recommend this course. Taking this course did not help me better understand what solutions journalism is or how to do it well. Professor Villagomez is unorganized and needed to communicate with us more. Additionally, it felt as though she did not know who I was or care about me, even as the quarter ended, despite the fact that I was the only person to arrive to class on time each week, I stayed after to speak with her multiple times, we emailed and we talked in our individual conference. I understand that she is a newer professor, and she is a super cool person, but I expect better from my Medill faculty, especially in a nine person class."
jour,jour,302,fall,Jonathan Marshall,5.13,4.63,4.79,4.06,4.81,6.01,"This is definitely a good class for anyone with a lot of interest in the presidents and the press. Professor Marshall is kind and wants to see everyone succeed, and that is very apparent. The assignments are fair and the readings are engaging. However, as a person of color, I kind of wish I had picked a different media history class because this one made little effort to go over anything related to diversity, and almost every single time I did look into a journalist of color, it was on my own accord. It maybe isn't that important for every single journalist to see this perspective but as a journalist of color who is interested in White House reporting, it almost made me feel like there wasn't a space for me there."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class felt very relevant, especially in today's media and political landscape which was really great. I highly recommend. The work wasn't too difficult ––– reflections, op–ed assignment and strategy memo."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class so much. I was already interested in the topic, but even if you aren't please take it! The workload is fair and the discussions and lectures are great."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, this class is fine, and from what I've heard, the best of the classes offered for the media history requirement. The assignments are a decent amount of work (mostly short papers with tedious research requirements that can feel a bit high school), but you can definitely get an A in this class with minimal effort; readings are sometimes interesting but not at all needed aside from having to skim a couple each week for the reflections. I'm not completely sure what the goal of this class is – the first couple weeks consist of learning the story of Watergate through multiple sources of varied format and style, and then you make your way through the various presidents and J–Marsh essentially sits at the front of the class and talks about their relationship with the press, but the class was often disengaged because everyone knew we would not need to use the material at all. J–Marsh is a sweet guy but don't be fooled by his kind presence; he takes the assignments seriously (although you will get an A as long as you make sure to meet the requirements) and isn't fond of giving extensions. Very knowledgeable prof but can border on arrogant sometimes with assigning lots of his own material and bragging about past experience and interviews."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was great! Prof. Marshall is a great teacher and person in general. He really cares about his students and I can't recommend this class enough.
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you have any interest in the history between presidents and the media, this class is for you. Professor Marshall is terrific (as both a teacher and a human being) and always makes class worthwhile. While the assignments feel a bit tedious, the workload is generally manageable and the grading fair."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked Prof. Marshall, it is a decent amount of work and you can't skip but a good option for Media History"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course. Marshall is a great professor and really cares. Even if youre not interested in the topic, its really good information to know as a journalist."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I took this class because I needed a media history credit. Although I really don't like politics, this course was not difficult to do well in if you were willing to put in the work. Prof. Marshall did everything he could to make the class interesting and engaging, and he really cared about his students, gave great feedback, and genuinely cared about how we were doing."
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof. Marshall was extremely passionate about this subject and had a lot of knowledge. I found this course super interesting and engaging.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is one of those classes where everyone sounds really smart during discussion, but when you take a step back, you realize that no one is actually saying much. I felt like we had a LOT of conversations about the media's role without really coming to any tangible conclusions or goals. A lot of students were doing other stuff on their computers during lecture. Prof. Marshall is very nice, but don't expect him to hand out extensions! He does cultivate a warm, fun class environment – you'll get to know all your classmates' favorite songs. A lot of the readings are from his own book, as analyzing presidents and the press is basically his life's work. You have to do the readings to complete the bi–weekly reflections. The op–ed assignment is the big one of the quarter, and Prof. Marshall makes it a huge deal – I did feel really proud of all of our work on that assignment! Overall, I don't know if this subject works as a 10 week course. I wish we had spent less time on Woodward and Bernstein and heard from some more female voices."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't think there's enough information about Watergate to talk about it for 10 weeks. Prof Marshall is very supportive and cares about his students, but the class is very repetitive and there's not a very clear structure to it. Most classes were Prof. Marshall lecturing about different presidents without any slides. The op–ed assignment is the most valuable part of the class, but I'm not sure it makes this class worth taking."
jour,jour,302,fall,Bradley Hamm,3.62,3.75,3.83,2.92,3.46,3.00,"Thought classes were super unproductive, but was excited by projects"
,,,,,,,,,,,Not the most exciting class but gives good background knowledge for journalism.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was super easy and most of the things we learned were just route memorization. However, the teaching style was mostly just talking at the class and we were discouraged from taking notes which meant that if you didn't remember something from class you had to google it for the exams which was kind of annoying. Prof. Hamm is super nice, but the style of teaching prevented the class from being engaged."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is completely lecture–based. There are 2 exams about course content and 2 essay projects. Professor Hamm gives you a study guide for the exams prior and it is identical to the exam content. The class requires minimal work but Professor Hamm's instructions are often unclear.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Hamm just wants us to learn the most with minimized effort. I really liked that his exams were not meant to trick us, and he told us exactly what would be on the midterm. Also– he gave us gift cards for taking the first midterm! Super generous and flexible. He usually lets us out 20–30 minutes early too. The material is super easy, and we didn't have to spend a penny on the class. Professor Hamm is a great contact to have in terms of connecting you to people who can help you with your career interests."
,,,,,,,,,,,I was hesitant about taking this class at first but I felt like it was definitely worth it. It’s an important class and I learned a lot about famous journalistic work and laws that affect journalism. The projects were interesting but I do wish we received more feedback for them.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is easy but not super engaging. I did it for the major requirement, and it was definitely easy to do well in the class"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Probably the easiest Medill class out there besides 202, very easy A. Not a lot of putting stuff into practice but incredibly low–effort, just take notes in class and you're good. Two projects: An interview with your grandparent + a paper and a short research paper on the coverage of an event in the 20th century of your choice. Two exams, but Hamm gives you the questions beforehand. TAKE THIS WHEN THE REST OF YOUR COURSE LOAD IS HARD!!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is interesting but not very challenging and I did not learn much.
jour,jour,302,spring,Bradley Hamm,3.33,3.43,3.29,3.00,3.50,3.00,"This class is okay. It's not a ton of work (almost none), and you'll be fine for the two exams as long as you look at the study guide beforehand. The only problem is that it can get really boring, but other than that it's fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Don't. Take 302 with someone else. Don't take this one just because it works well with your schedule. Take a different 302 or take 302 another quarter. The class is just hours of Hamm talking about various isolated incidents related to propaganda or misinformation, often going at length on an obvious idea, which comes off as very condescending. It's a pain to sit through and I didn't learn anything beyond trivia about a few historical anecdotes. The content is also incredibly whitewashed, I don't think the course mentioned a single non–white person except for a brief look at a commercial featuring Michael Jordan."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Hamm really cares about his students and his topic a lot. If you go to class and quickly go over the study guides he sends out before the 2 quizzes, and complete your final 5–page research paper, you will be fine, it is not hard at all. Lecture consists of him talking about some topic, and there's almost no assigned reading or work outside of class, making it a very easy way to fill your media history requirement. I didn't really learn much other than a few vocab words surrounding communication industry and propaganda."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course had the potential to be very interesting but fell short due to how disorganized it was. We barely had any assignments on which to base our grade and those that we did have felt like random add ons that were meant to provide the professor with something to grace us on.
jour,jour,302,spring,Jonathan Marshall,5.17,4.74,4.75,4.04,4.96,4.51,"I knew JMarsh was a well–liked professor going in, and I can still see why — he's pretty friendly and seems passionate. Still, I can't say this class was ever engaging or felt meaningful. There were a ton of small homework assignments and daily in–class tasks that just felt like busywork, and we also didn't learn much in class that we could actually apply in our assignments, which again felt like they were designed just for the sake of us getting assignments. A good class for an easy distro, it just gets really grating at times."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this class overall. Professor Marshall is very enthusiastic and tries his best to connect with every student in his class. His classes were very engaging and fun. However, some of his grading can be harsh in unexpected ways. I still thought it was overall a nice class! It is a requirement but I think I learned a lot from it."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Marshall is probably one of the nicest professors of all time. Highly recommend taking this class!
,,,,,,,,,,,Pros: This class is low workload and Marshall is a great guy. You also get to read of a lot of interesting journalism you'd ordinarily never read. Cons: Feels like a waste of time to devote an entire course to something that isn't directly applicable to our careers. Could have been really boring but Jon Marshall was great at communicating ideas and making them digestible
,,,,,,,,,,,"For a required course, I appreciated that this class wasn't anything crazy in terms of difficulty. It was fun, interactive, and the workload was minimal."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was cool, J Marsh is a great and passionate professor and the group assignments were fun and engaging. I particularly enjoyed the timeline assignment and aside from the readings, there wasn't too much time spent doing work outside of class"
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Marshall is so kind and a great professor!
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is a must take for medill students. Prof. Marshall made the course relatively easy with reading assignments that involved comments as well as interesting projects.
,,,,,,,,,,,"this class was what I expected, not too difficult but definitely a good amount of weekly work. compared to other 302 classes it seemed like a heavier workload, but JMarsh is super knowledgeable and I think the extra work is worth taking the class with him. learned a lot and the hardest/largest assignment is in the middle of the quarter so finals are not stressful which I appreciate"
,,,,,,,,,,,This professor is passive aggressive and condescending. Do with that what you will.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I can see that Prof. Marshall is trying to make the students stay in class and pay attention, but he is treating us like high school students or even younger ones. He tries to control too much and in such a patronizing way that it made me not want to listen, even the content is interesting sometimes. To be fair, Prof. Marshall is trying to be nice and considerate in class. But as long as there are tiny things that do not align with his expectation, he freaks out and uses passive aggressive ways to force the students to do what he wants. He tries to joke and ease it out while it's clear that he is upset about it. He says nice stuff in class like ""come to my office hours, I would love to meet each one of you."" But when I actually came, he seemed not interested in what I was saying and just want to go over really basic questions. It feels like he just wants to be a ""nice teacher"" on surface level. I am very uncomfortable about this because I'd rather have teachers who either trust the students more, or not care what each student is doing since we are adults already. Also, he really tries to control every little thing that happens in this class. He takes attendance every class using a notecard, which he would not give it to you if you are late. Every time you miss a class, you would need to say in advance and do a makeup assignment. I mean if the class is interesting enough, people would want to come. Forcing everyone to sit there using attendance pressure only makes the class a scheduled study hall. I have never even had a high school teacher who's this controlling, maybe primary school teachers do. Additionally, this class is focuses only on US media history. When I bring up other countries or cultures, Prof. Marshall is just verbally acknowledging that they are important but does not do anything about it. He clearly does not remember how to pronounce my name, despite his effort of reminding everyone to record on Name Coach in the first few lectures. Every time he says my name, it's always in a weird way that's remotely similar, and I can only tell because no one else in the class had the same starting syllables. He also did not include a lecture about international news history or anything. He also had a super short lecture about LGBTQ+ community (30 min max), compared to a full 80 min lecture for sports journalism. I guess this is understandable because this is his first time teaching this lecture, but again this just shows how Medill has not been keeping up with cultural differences and gender issues these days. I signed up for this class because I have seen good reviews about the class and professor. But my experience in the class made me never want to take his class ever. I find it really hard to understand why he was rated the best professor somewhere on instagram. If the content is interesting in itself, why having so much mandatory measures to ensure everyone's in class? Why using punitive measures to force everyone to come? My high school teachers don't even do this and I turned out fine. I can see that Prof. Marshall is trying to be clear and organized in class materials and contents, but I personally hate his style of teaching."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is highly recommended. Marshall is a great, fair professor and makes class pretty engaging. Assignments aren't too hard. Sometimes the readings are long, but you can skim them. The quizzes are open–note, so just make sure you take notes during class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"For a required media history class, I was expecting this class to be boring; however, that is far from the case. Prof. Marshal (J–Marsh!!) has so much energy and passion for this subject, and it is clearly visible from the way he lectures. I honestly really enjoyed every class, and the assignments on Perusall were not bad at all. I'd say, if you are choosing between 302 courses, definitely take this class with Jon Marshall."

Start your final paper as early as possible (it's 50% of your grade) and you don't have much work for the course aside from it (only 3 reflections that are 250 words each). Overall, an easy way to fulfill the media history requirement."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course is a Media History course, so if you're not interested in history at all it might be difficult to thoroughly focus. Nonetheless, Professor Chadha was very devoted in her teaching and she was a very friendly professor I've ever met. She's always open to talk and answer questions and tries her best to get students engaged in the course along with her. Do take it with her if you get the chance."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was honestly nervous to take this class, but it was easier than any history class I've taken at NU, and was actually interesting. I would not recommend buying the book as we only read it like three times, but the articles we explored in class were pretty interesting. I would have not preferred to have a final be 50% of my grade, but it ended up being OK, and the reflections are a breeze as long as you pay attention in class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a nice class. Prof. Chadha is super friendly, kind, and intelligent. The lectures are thoughtful and well done, and it is a very light workload –– only three reflections and a final paper. The problem with this class is that because it is less work, it is easy to push it aside in favor of other more academically–challenging courses. But it was always something to look forward to, and I appreciated the format. It could have been to good to have more engagement from the class, but Prof. Chadha is great! 10/10 would recommend taking this for your media history class; it's the best option!"

,,,,,,,,,,,Our class discussions were really engaging and professor Chadha was a great lecturer!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Chadha is a great professor, really interesting and cares about students. I just didn't love the content. It didn't feel relevant and I think its really outdated in Medill."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would say that this is one of the easier classes I've taken at Medill. There were only 4 assignments the entire quarter, 3 of which I completed in under 30 minutes. Professor Chadha is very knowledgeable about the subject, but the class itself just isn't that engaging. It's hard to pack 200 years of journalism history into a class and make it interesting, especially since most of the history went along with things I had already learned in United States History classes. However, I don't fault Professor Chadha for this, since this was just the nature of the course. I would absolutely take another class with her, she did the most she could within the confines of the course description."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As we neared the end, learning more about modern journalism and its development was really interesting. The class exercises we did where we discussed and picked apart recent examples of journalism was my favorite part of the class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"A class that I would only take as a requirement. Professor Chadha does her best to make the class interactive and enjoyable, and she herself is a saint, but the course material just is not engaging. The readings are long and provide a decent background to class lecture at best."

jour,jour,303,winter,Christopher Benson,4.82,4.36,4.18,3.59,4.59,3.17,"not a bad class at all. while the three hours is pretty long, the workload is not bad. two discussion posts, two short essays, and one short final essay. Lectures go by a lot faster when people engage in discussion. Professor Benson is awesome. if you pay attention he cracks a pretty good amount of jokes in class. i think the course itself is very important, but i think if there were more in–class activities or shorter lectures it would be a little better."
,,,,,,,,,,,"At times it felt like Benson's opinions were just thrown out there. It would help if this course was set up more interactively. Overall, it is just Benson telling us his opinions on different current day issues for three hours... kinda tough to sit through and learn a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Benson is great, solid professor, awesome guy. Pretty interesting, low stakes class. Definitely take this"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is manageable. Some of the content is obvious, but still important to talk about."
,,,,,,,,,,,"really hard class to be in for 3 hours–– important topic but something we cover a lot at medill so felt redundant. wish it was more engaging and involved for more discussion/activities, especially given length of class sessions. not a hard class but not one of my favorites at medill"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is definitely for you if you're looking for a low–workload non–reporting journalism class. The topic is very important and relevant today, but I feel like most of what we talked about in class was kind of common sense (don't be racist). Lectures were very long and it seemed like no one in the class was really paying attention ever. Only assignments were two discussion posts and three 700ish word responses. A very important topic, but I don't feel like it was covered in a way that taught anything new. Probably would be a great class for older generations."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Although the class can get tiring since it is 3 hours long, the issues we learn about in class are super important and relevant to today. The professor brings up real life current events, which helps, and he is super understanding and accommodating. There is not much work and grading is pretty easy– would recommend especially if you're not looking to take a reporting class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is an extremely long and large class, which I thought was to its detriment, as it was often hard to concentrate the whole time or have meaningful discussions. Much of each class was spent recapping material from the previous week, and not all but a lot of the material felt surface–level to anyone who has a passing understanding of DEI. Not difficult but I never felt like I was learning very much."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was definitely not too much work and covered a lot of interesting topics and had good discussions. However, the discussions were few and far between and the class was typically just a lecture. Additionally, there were certain topics that were covered far less than others, as opposed to an even spread and dive into each type of identity. However, it did help me think about word choice which is definitely important as a journalist."
,,,,,,,,,,,this class was good but it’s tough because people didn’t want to talk and he tried to engage the class but it didn’t seem to be workinh
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was really looking forward to taking this class. To say it was a disappointment would be a major understatement. It could have been a really interesting class, but Professor Bensen literally lectures at you for three hours straight. In addition, I wasn't challenged intellectually AT ALL. Professor Bensen's ""lessons"" literally consist of him saying the most obvious painfully things ever, like ""stereotyping is bad."" Instead of him saying ""stereotypes are harmful,"" what would have been much more effective is if he had us read articles and dissect whether they employed stereotypes, etc. This is a Framed: Media and the Marginalized class, and yet Professor Bensen devoted less than five minutes (I timed it) to discussing how disabled individuals are marginalized by the media. He said it was ""too obvious to talk about"" — even though everything we learned in this class was painfully obvious. He also used derogatory language to describe disabled people, like ""differently–abled."" A quick google search would have shown him how offensive that terminology is. I totally understand that not everyone understands the proper terminology to use, but if you're teaching a course on media marginalization and talk about the importance of using proper language, you have no excuse to not do your research. I got an A in this course, but we were literally graded on how well we mimicked what Professor Bensen said in class. There was no conversation or free–thinking. Professor Bensen said he encouraged us to challenge him, but he would pose one–sided questions that you couldn't possibly refute unless you're a really shitty person, like ""are offensive jokes funny?"" In conclusion, I learned absolutely nothing of substance in this class and was highly offended by his lesson (or lack thereof) on disability, but if you're looking for a class to nap in, this is for you."
,,,,,,,,,,,"this class is interesting and important to take for any journalist. there's a lot of content though, and sometimes the lectures can get long/content–heavy because its a 3hr class. would def recommend though!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class for a diverse cultures distro, prof benson is very understanding and flexible. Class periods can be long but it's nice to have once a week, and minimal work outside of class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Incredibly course– MUST TAKE for any Medill student and any Northwestern students interested!
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is very chill and benson is great
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a super chill class with a very manageable workload outside of it. Professor Benson's humor is amazing and he clearly cares a lot about the subject, and is very accommodating to his students about deadlines as well. Since it was a 3 hour meeting the class could sometimes feel really long, but the content overall is still important to know, and I feel that I'll be more careful about particularly my headlines and newswriting from this."
,,,,,,,,,,,I was excited for this class but it was somewhat disappointing. It felt a bit like an echo chamber and there was definitely a way to make it more engaging but a 3 hour lecture is tough.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was an incredibly easy Medill credit. Highly recommend. The professor made interesting points about problems with the media sometimes, and our discussions could be engaging, but you also don't have to pay attention if you don't want to. This quarter, we had 2 discussion posts, 2 600ish word reports and one final. The class definitely could have gone deeper into ways that journalists can actually improve and do a more ethical job, though."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Benson is a very thoughtful professor who is very good at breaking down complex topics. I wish this class weren't three hours long/once a week and that it were a bit smaller, because I feel like the length and size of the class made it a little more intimidating to participate sometimes."
jour,jour,305,winter,Bradley Hamm,5.71,5.86,4.71,4.86,5.86,3.00,"Since this class is half a credit winter quarter and half a credit spring quarter, we didn't do much winter quarter and spent most of the time preparing to go to Japan. The professor is nice and brought in a bunch of Japanese snacks which was amazing, and during class time, a lot of past students spoke to us (over Zoom) about their experiences and we were able to ask them questions and advice."
,,,,,,,,,,,"While only the first half, this course so far did a great job in preparing us for a trip abroad."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class isn't finished yet.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is only halfway done because it goes into next quarter as well, but it has bene a really positive experience so far. Prof. Hamm is so passionate about Japan and its culture, and he really wants us to have as much love and understanding for it as he does. He brought back past students on Zoom to tell us about their experiences, and planned the trip so we would have the best experience possible and be able to see all aspects of Japan, from the culture to the journalism to the tourist attractions. I would highly recommend taking this class if you are able to."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Hamm is awesome!! He understands that learning is not about exams and grades and goes above and beyond to ensure that his students have an immersive experience. I’m really excited to travel to Japan! I just wish that we learned more skills in this class, like how to say basic Japanese phrases, how to bow, cultural norms, etc. But highly recommend this JOURney!!"
jour,jour,305,winter,Bob Rowley,6.00,5.71,5.86,5.43,6.00,3.00,"Only halfway through this course at the time I'm writing this because its a half credit in winter and spring. SO far great class, Prof Rowley is amazing and guest speakers have been super interesting!"
,,,,,,,,,,,An amazing class that helps you think critically on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and how you should go about reporting on it.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Love! Super cool guest speakers, really important topic. Looking forward to the trip. The written report to find the local in the global was a great assignment."
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a really interesting course and the professors are great. The trip is in a week so more info to come..
jour,jour,305,winter,Karen Springen,5.50,5.50,3.25,3.50,5.75,4.60,"If you're at all interested in going to London or arts and culture reporting, taking this class is a MUST! Professor Springen is so fun and genuinely cares about seeing your work published, and she offers thorough feedback without grading harshly. She also brings in Medill grads who took this same class with her and are working at major magazines now, so it's cool to see where you could possibly end up in your career. Couldn't recommend this class more!"
,,,,,,,,,,,A great prep course to prepare for the London trip with a focus on meeting really cool Medill alums and learning more about their careers! A big focus on freelancing/pitching relative to other Medill classes. Prof. Springen always comes to class with cookies which is always nice.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I love prof springen <3 she is so sweet and understanding and I feel like the things I learn in this class are very practical, and I can tell that's something Karen really emphasizes for the class. I think sometimes, material gets a little bit repetetive, but I feel like there's a limited number of topics you can lecture about in a journalism class"
jour,jour,305,spring,Bradley Hamm,5.00,5.33,4.33,3.67,5.33,3.00,"The trip to Japan was fantastic. I appreciated Professor Hamm arranging Zoom calls with previous students before the trip so we could hear about their experiences in Japan. Professor Hamm is very well–versed in Japan, and I loved the personal touch of meeting his family. From an educational standpoint, however, I did not learn much. The course structure before and after the trip seemed erratic and random. Professor Hamm often went off on unrelated tangents for half an hour about aspects unrelated to Japan. I left class every Monday thinking, ""Why was what I learned useful?"" The assignments he asked of us seem just as erratic and random. Professor Hamm has to rethink his course structure and delegate which lessons are most critical to have the best experience possible in Japan."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is by far the best course I’ve taken at Northwestern!! If you’re debating whether you should do this JOURney, DO IT! The trip to Japan was one of the best experiences of my life, and it expanded my perspective. I think all aspiring journalists, especially solutions journalists, should study abroad. Professor Hamm is a very laid back professor who values experiences over academic assessments and grades. I could not recommend this course more!"
jour,jour,305,spring,Bob Rowley,5.80,5.80,6.00,5.67,5.80,5.00,"If you want to know what it's like to be a foreign correspondent or learn about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, this class is perfect."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you have interest in being a foreign correspondent or having any interest in politics then this course is definitely worth taking. It's such an incredible experience and Bob and Jill are the BEST and made traveling so far feel super comfortable. It's not a relaxing trip, but definitely special and if you are considering it, I would recommend going for sure."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is an amazing class and I would recommend it to anyone in Medill! I learned so much about the Israel–Palestine conflict and getting to travel there was an incredible opportunity. Bob and Jill are awesome too.
,,,,,,,,,,,This was an awesome class and I'd recommend taking it if you have any interest in the Israel–Palestine conflict or being a foreign correspondent. Traveling to Israel and the Palestinian territories was an incredible opportunity.
jour,jour,305,spring,Karen Springen,5.33,5.33,5.33,5.33,5.33,3.00,"Guest speakers are cool! Karen is lovely but I don't think I got much from the (usually brief) lectures. London is fun, you get plenty of time to do your own thing."
jour,jour,311,fall,Patti Wolter,5.90,5.83,5.75,5.75,5.82,8.00,"Quite possibly my favorite Medill course. While it focuses on editing, I feel like my understanding of structure and story ideation has made me a much better editor as well. It was almost like a bootcamp, but I feel incredibly confident in my writing and editing skills after this class. Patti is wonderful, and I recommend you reach out if you ever need anything/have anything going on!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I ABSOLUTELY loved this class so much!! Patti is an amazing professor and genuinely cares about each student and is always willing to talk after class/give advice. I want to go into magazine writing and this class gave a great overview of the industry. While I initially wasn't as open or partial to editing itself, Patti also made me realize that editing can be just as fun and rewarding as writing. The work load is definitely a lot and I spent more time on this class than others, but as long as you don't procrastinate and space it out well over the week, it's manageable. I think the work you put into this class makes it extremely valuable and worth it. Highly recommend this class if you're interested in magazines at all. My only regret is that this course wasn't longer."
,,,,,,,,,,,Such a good class!! Patti is an amazing and kind professor who really wants you to succeed and helps you along the way. It's a lot of work for sure but everything was interesting and actually helps you learn how to edit and pitch stories. You definitely have to put in the work and not put it off but this is easily one of the best classes I've taken in Medill.
,,,,,,,,,,,This is without a doubt my favorite Journalism class I’ve taken. Patti is an incredible professor and so supportive. Highly recommend taking this class if you’re interested in aspects of journalism beyond reporting/writing.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Patti is an AMAZING professor. Probably the best Medill professor I've ever had. She is so kind, considerate and caring toward her students. She's also highly flexible, which helped because her assignments were... hefty. Let's say I spent, on average, 10+ hours on every project she assigned. But, the assignments were very topical. But if you register for this class, remember that most of your grades are these massive, heavily weighted, weekly assignments that are fun to do, no doubt, but so much work. But this class prepares you for the real world of journalism. She brings in these fantastic guest speakers who work at great news outlets, and she clarifies that magazine, or better yet journalism, has no ""one right path."" I would highly recommend it if you don't have a hefty workload."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVE THIS CLASS. Patti is the kindest person and has a true passion for what she teaches. I learned so much about editing, production, and the business of magazines. Patti makes content interesting and digestible. The assignments can at times feel daunting, but she is always willing to work with you and help. You get out of this class what you put into it – if you care about the assignments you will do well. Not an easy–A, but one of my favorite classes I've ever taken. If you're even remotely interested in magazine take this!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVED THIS COURSE! It's one of the few that feel directly applicable to a journalism career. While its a lot of work, Patti is super nice and will help you through it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a really great class, the prof cares a lot about the students and about making sure everyone is learning and getting the most out of the course. There is a decent workload but it's not unmanageable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really solid class. It’s a lot of actually doing editing and story ideation, which works really well in conjunction with learning the grammar, industry scene, etc. Not the easiest class, especially given the time required for some of the bigger assignments (we have a huge developmental edit that we need to do where we cut a long story down in half), but I found it very useful as far as Medill curricula goes. It prepared me directly for writing more and editing more, and those are always useful skills. Patti was a great professor, very warm and approachable but also able to give substantive and useful feedback. Would highly recommend this class if you want to be a better writer and if you’re up for a more challenging experience."
,,,,,,,,,,,"At first I was frustrated with how much work I was doing because I wasn't sure it was worth it, but as the course went on I realized I was becoming more confident in my writing and editing"
jour,jour,311,winter,Douglas Foster,5.40,5.33,5.07,4.73,5.27,4.07,"Lot of mixed feelings and will talk through in a brain dump. Really liked prof as a person, am interested in magazine editing to begin with, and loved the speakers that came to talk with us. The class was structured as one long project, so it was easy to chip away at with a group and I understand why we worked on a pitch because it is directly applicable to a journalism career. However, it was rare to know what you were supposed to be doing as there were very little guidelines about assignments, due dates, expectations, etc. There were barely any grades, which can either be great or awful. I really like the idea and theology of the class but in practice was a little messy."
,,,,,,,,,,,"LOVED this class. I learned so much about different magazines, and enjoyed exploring one that I was genuinely interested in. Got very close with all my classmates and made some nice networking connections with NU alumni working for magazines."
,,,,,,,,,,,"My initial reaction to the course was that it felt a bit old–school. We were talking about magazines in a very traditional sense, and talking about editorial work within a written piece exclusively. However, towards the end, when we talked about special packages for current publications, I felt our conversations were very in line with today's magazine scene, and very helpful in gaining new insight to the minds of my peers and the future of journalism."
,,,,,,,,,,,Foster is so amazing and sweet! Class felt a little disorganized at times but really enjoyed it especially the final package
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is AMAZING!! Prof Foster has definitely improved this class with each iteration. In the class we choose one magazine outlet to follow and learn their editorial DNA, voice, and audience as create a special package for them. I truly learned so much about magazine editing and business through the assignments and amazing guest speakers and Professor Foster is so caring and attentive to the class. I also had an amazing group for this project but seriously this class reignited why I actually wanted to be in journalism again and I cannnot recommend it enough, especially if you're at all interested in the magazine industry!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is such a fun class! Professor Foster is so nice and cool, and you can tell he genuinely enjoys teaching this class. As far as work goes, it's pretty light. You have 3 small assignments to do outside of class on editing and choosing magazine pieces to review. Other than that, your main work is in–class activities and working with your magazine group to create 2 presentations, one of which is an overview on your magazine and one is a pitch for your magazine. Foster's lectures can go on for a bit, but he gives breaks during class so you won't ever feel like it takes too much time. If you need an easy 300 that's still fun and like actually informational (plus no reporting!) take this!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked this class. You develop a toolkit of skills that are directly applicable to editing, which no Medill class had previously given me beyond self–editing practices. Some days it was hard to determine why we were talking about what we were talking about, but I think as the quarter progressed, our instruction became more clear. This class is very group work heavy, so if that's not your jam, keep that in mind, but I think everyone in the class developed good bonds with their groupmates."
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof Foster is great! He has so much experience in the journalism field and it was really cool to learn from someone who is still writing for distinguished publications. He brought in a ton of really interesting speakers that I learned a lot from. He really cares about his students and wants their input on the class to make it as rewarding as possible. IF YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE THIS CLASS TAKE IT WITH PROF FOSTER! I have other friends who took this class a quarter before and had essays due almost every week. We only had two assignments and one final presentation the whole quarter. Work was very manageable and class content was interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I absolutely loved this class and Professor Foster! While the course is focused on magazine, I think it was a really great crash course in editorial judgment, story/publication development and conceptual/line editing that would be incredibly valuable to anyone in Medill, even those who don't think they want to go into the magazine field. Prof. Foster was highly knowledgeable, prepared, kind and attentive to the class's needs, questions and concerns throughout every step of the course—he's for sure one of my favorite professors in Medill so far! We also had frequent guest speakers from various media backgrounds who added a lot to what we were doing in class. One thing to know, however, is that the course revolves heavily around long–term group work, so if you're really anti–group–project, this may not be the class for you...but honestly I think the class is so great that it would be worth it to push through group work even if you're not a fan :)"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really wanted to take this course because I thought my Medill ""concentration"" (lol) was magazine journalism and it was unfortunately disappointing. The course structure was unorganized and grading was arbitrary. If you enjoy discussing print journalism and magazines you will have fun. It was just not right for me. Prof. Foster is obviously passionate about magazine journalism but I do not think his expertise translated into his lectures/the classes because I do not feel like I am walking away with an improved understanding of what it takes to work at a magazine. Again, I know there are students who really enjoyed this class, so maybe you will too."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you want to learn how an editorial room for a magazine works, this course is for you. Professor Foster does a great job of incorporating old and new ideas about magazine journalism into the coursework. There's also a great collaborative aspect to the class."
jour,jour,311,spring,Douglas Foster,5.70,5.60,5.40,4.90,5.90,4.20,I really enjoyed this class. It's mostly project–based: you choose a real magazine in a group and develop a special package for that publication. It was pretty fun and not too difficult. I feel like I learned about the magazine business. It was nice to not have to do any reporting but still get to work on journalism skills and learn more about the industry.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class. Doug is really sweet and you can tell he genuinely cares about his students and our education. This class is a lot of group work, as Doug has you split into groups within the first week so each group has the chance to focus on a different magazine. Assignments include editing exemplary pieces of your magazine of choice as well as ones that are not as good. The whole class is basically focused on producing a special package for your magazine of choice, with a few editorial exercises sprinkled in here and there. Sometimes Doug's instructions were a little vague, but if you asked him follow up questions he would help clarify things. Overall, I would recommend this class if you are interested in magazine editing or just don't want to take another writing and reporting heavy journalism class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"this class was super interesting! prof foster clearly loves what he does and cares about his students learning and experience in class. i think some previous ctecs have been a bit overly harsh but there are occasionally random assignments (ie. reflections/memos) that are not in the syllabus that will pop up. still worth taking the class, i learned a lot through experience and really loved the guest speakers"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was very chill yet I still feel like I came out of it having learned a lot. There was some disorganization that was mostly due to the Canvas page not being up to date for most of the quarter and just having to rely on verbal instructions, however, there was not a copious amount of outside work which made this not too big of an issue. I do think this is one of those classes where if the class doesn't mesh well it will not be as productive. Luckily, everyone who took the course this quarter was very willing to participate and add to class discussions. The final project is fun to do and is really not as daunting as it sounds, came together super fast in the end."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great course, would recommend if you're interested in working on a magazine in the future or if you just have a general interest in editing. The workload is manageable and I was able to apply what I learned to my work with the campus publication I work on."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Foster is truly one of the best professors and teachers I've ever had, and it was a true privilege learning from him. He is so kind and insightful, and he creates an amazing environment that facilitates both personal and collective growth. Take this class if you are interested in magazines!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was one of my favorite classes at Medill and at Northwestern in general. If you have any interest in magazines or creative development, you should definitely take this class. I will admit that it's quite a bit of work with substantial reading and time spent working on the projects that cumulate throughout the quarter, but it truly is a class where I can say I walked away knowing more about magazines, myself and my peers. Professor Foster is a gem, and while the class can feel slightly disorganized at times, his insights and feedback make it all worth it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Favorite journalism class I've taken at Medill so far. Professor Foster is great, so kind and knowledgable, and really cares about having you get the most out of the class. The occasional assignments are not that challenging and have lots of creative freedom, the final project is spaced across the whole quarter so it was never really a point of stress. Definitely take if you like magazine!"
jour,jour,312,fall,Lawrence Stuelpnagel,4.88,4.88,4.75,4.25,5.50,6.00,"Larry is the best! He cares so much about his students and gets to know them personally. This class was great for an intro to broadcasting, from producing to anchoring. Not too much of a workload and working in teams was great."
,,,,,,,,,,,I felt like I got the most out of producing a newscast. There are so many components that the producer needs to keep track of so it was a very good leadership opportunity.
,,,,,,,,,,,I really appreciated how this course fosters collaboration and teamwork with group–produced shows each week. I improved my production and anchoring skills. I was really enjoyed watching our team's progress throughout the quarter.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class required a lot of work to be put in, but everything I did helped me improve my writing and video editing skills. It was also cool to try different parts of broadcast news to see where I would fit most."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course gave me real–world experience that will be helpful to my future career. It helped me explore the aspects of journalism I like and don't like relating to video and newscasts.
,,,,,,,,,,,This was an enjoyable class and filming the shows are really fun after the first couple of times. I do think that it would have been more helpful to see feedback and grades in Canvas versus waiting to see your grades at the end of the quarter. I also would have liked to have more opportunities to produce throughout the quarter.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVED this class. I had been interested in TV/broadcast news for a long time and this was the first class that I felt actually helped me gain valuable experience in that. The course is very collaborative, and you will learn how to trust your team, help each other out when needed, and work on the fly. The course is very repetitive with the same weekly show, but since assignment roles change every week and you are reporting on different stories. It gives just the right amount of variety to keep things interesting but also allows you to improve greatly. Larry is a very thoughtful and constructive professor and will give you all the feedback and mentorship you need to succeed. He is a great resource so don't hesitate to befriend him!"
,,,,,,,,,,,COST ALERT – You probably don't need to buy an external hard drive if you are tight on budget for it
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is kind of a necessary class if you are interested in broadcast journalism, whether that's being on–air or producing! Larry is a great professor who really cares about seeing students succeed. The class would definitely be more beneficial for people who are sophomores/not that involved with NNN yet as it teaches you a lot of the skills you can learn there."
jour,jour,319,fall,Jeremy Gilbert,5.59,5.00,4.82,4.47,5.38,4.41,Great class. Course content aligned with my interests and made me curious to learn more about media business models and tech.
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof. Gilbert is really nice and his class gives you a great introduction to innovations in journalism. I wish the topic were a bit more varied as it felt like we were talking only about AI for the whole quarter.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was awesome. It was a great chance to bond with members of the Bay Area Immersion cohort as well as set a great foundation on media design and innovation. If you love entrepreneurship and innovation, take this course! You learn a lot about yourself in this space and it provides a great opportunity to grow. I also loved how many guest speakers from media companies come to speak with us because it is so applicable to the real world."
,,,,,,,,,,,"While I loved the prof, the content was pretty boring for me. I try to have a growth mindset about it, but I'm not really inclined naturally to be into tech and AI. For that reason, I didn't like it that much."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Gilbert is such a professional yet approachable person – you can tell he really knows a lot about his field and is always willing to help. He made this class exciting and it was a wonderful experience overall. I also really got to learn about how AI impacts media and most of the guest speakers were interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,Jeremy is amazing! he’s so nice and personable! The class is a little boring but overall helpful and fun. not a lot of work
,,,,,,,,,,,"The material was interesting, though not particularly challenging. It was a great introduction for the Bay Area Immersion program to give me an idea of the skills I will gain."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Gilbert is the GOAT. This class is a blast. Getting to meet the rest of the BAIP is super cool. Plus the class is chill. Minimal work. The class has long hours but we always end around 1 –1.5 hours early depending on the day. Guest speakers are brought in everyweek and are awe–inspiring (we got to talk to people from BBC, AP, NYT and founders like Trei brundrett)"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class and highly encourage anyone interested in AI and entrepreneurship to take it. During class time, several entrepreneurs spoke to our class, such as a VOX cofounder and numerous other intrepreneurs. The work that is assigned in this class is very interesting and accessible. Professor Gilbert was an excellent professor who made a sustained effort to make the class as interesting as possible."
jour,jour,320,winter,Jill Blackman,5.82,5.71,5.59,4.71,5.76,3.70,Absolutely take this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Jill is a great teacher. She's pretty knowledgable about coding, online visualizations, etc. I didn't know HTML, JQuery, or CSS, but she made it really easy to understand the basics. The HTML quiz was really easy as well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot of resources for interactive journalism that I had no clue about before this class. It was really a comprehensive list of stuff. Definitely would recommend just for the online tools you learn about, like Flourish studio, Shorthand, etc."
,,,,,,,,,,,Really really useful class if you want to learn very basic CompSci skills that are applicable to journalism. Definitely learned more from this class than most other Medill classes I have taken
,,,,,,,,,,,"this was such a great class!! if you want to learn beyond just the writing how journalism stories are actually produced for the web, this is a really valuable course. I'm surprised there aren't more classes like it at Medill. You learn how to make graphs/charts, news quizzes, story maps and timelines and how to use softwares that embed all of these elements directly onto a news page. While the beginning/middle portion of the class is slow because you're learning how to use HTML, which is a little boring, it really picks up in the last few weeks and you get to do in–class activities like a breaking news simulation and then work on your own digital story for a final project. My one recommendation is that I wish we had done more in–class assignments throughout where we broke out into groups to make maps, charts, etc. since that was always my favorite part of class. overall highly recommend for any medill student"
,,,,,,,,,,,"As someone who did not enjoy any other Northwestern CS classes, including CS 110, this was a great way to actually learn about coding and data visualizations without feeling super confused and overwhelmed. Professor Blackman is a super enthusiastic instructor and I was able to reach her numerous times outside of class through text to get quick answers to my questions. Definitely learned a lot without feeling like I was jumping head–first into the unknown. Take this class if you can!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was awesome. I wanted to try something a little outside of my comfort zone in regard to data visualization and both this class and Prof. Blackman completely surpassed my expectations. I learned a ton, beyond just the baseline for interactive storytelling."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a ton of fun! Super different from other Medill classes in a way that was engaging, refreshing, and exciting. I loved getting to explore another side of journalism and learning more about technology and story–building platforms. Would highly recommend this course for anyone looking for a lower work load, but high learning Medill elective"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course did a great job focusing not only on creating interactive media, but also critiquing interactive media, which gave me a good idea of what media is valuable to produce."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was great and Jill was awesome! The final project was fun and it was great to walk away with a visual story clip
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great class if you're looking for a 300–level journalism elective!! It teaches you a lot about how to create digital stories, and the final project is very flexible in letting you actually report on something you're interested in. Professor Blackman is so engaging, kind and of course knowledgeable about the subject of interactive storytelling!"
,,,,,,,,,,,It was really easy to follow and helped me learn
,,,,,,,,,,,I thought it was really interesting because I learned something entirely new. It wasn't every scary either because Professor Blackman was really great about walking us through each step.
,,,,,,,,,,,Very well–organized class with a very well–spoken professor. Definitely learned a lot from this class despite not spending as much time on homework as I thought.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot about the fundamental skills of HTML, CSS, and jQuery that I was initially completely new to. It was new but interesting and fun experience that I enjoyed a lot, especially regarding the final project"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was one of my favorite classes I have taken. As a journalism major pursuing the Segal Design Certificate, I was able to see how design could be incorporated into my storytelling. The class builds upon coding and interactive skills each week, so it wasn't stressful and allowed for learning and growth. I learned so much about html, jQuery and CSS, and and am so grateful for Professor Blackman's guidance."
jour,jour,320,spring,Jill Blackman,5.69,5.44,5.44,4.81,5.50,5.00,i learned a ton about multimedia elements and digital storytelling that i wanted to learn. it was a bit tough since the class covers so much but i did learn a lot. wish there were more additional classes at NU where i could have done these things specifically but really liked this course.
,,,,,,,,,,,This is an excellent class if you need a journalism requirement. Prof. Blackman is awesome and very knowledgeable. The assignments weren't bad if you paid attention they went quickly.
,,,,,,,,,,,"prof blackman is awesome, and this course is great –– definitely take it as a journalism elective!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"really great journalism class to take, and probably an essential class for any journalism major to take at nu. prof. blackman is very understanding with work, and assigns a manageable workload each week. you'll need to spend more time on larger projects like presentations and the final project, but it was never unmanageable. you learn a lot about a variety of topics, and build a more well–rounded journalism skill set through html/data visualizations/social media/digital and audience engagement."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class taught me a lot of skills that I quickly put on my resume and I think will be very applicable in the future, like HTML and jQuery. I do wish we spent more time learning how to refine our code and make it look more professional. Also, the organization of the class was a little hectic but it was spaced out enough where it wasn't an issue for getting things done on time."
,,,,,,,,,,,Jill is the sweetest professor and really cares about her students. Sometimes the coding can be a lot but if you have no CS background and want to at least know a little bit you should take this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course, I feel like it will be very helpful for my future."
,,,,,,,,,,,I liked this class and it is very doable even if you don't have any experience with HTML (I did not). Professor Blackman is very open to helping with assignments and answering questions. Mostly small assignments and then one group project at the end. I would recommend this class to Medill students interested in interactive features of stories
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought it was a great course. We learned a lot, especially during the first few weeks, but in a fun and engaging way. Prof. Jill was great and very understanding!!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is pretty good, especially for Medill! Professor Blackman is super helpful and the content is interesting, if a little redundant at times. I enjoyed the stories we read and created and feel inspired to continue learning about html in the future. The assignments are relatively easy (very manageable) and there is not too much reporting!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,You will learn a lot of useful data tools and the professor is very willing to help if you are having trouble.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a pretty solid journalism elective. You learn how to code HTML and make interactive data visualizations, which will be useful in the journalism profession. The work load is pretty light, but the final project takes quite a bit of work."
jour,jour,321,fall,Steven Thrasher,3.83,3.50,3.67,3.67,4.00,6.34,What was done in class time did not connect to our assignments at all.
,,,,,,,,,,,Class is ok. Nice book.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was absurd, in the best way. While I originally took this class as a elective requirement for Journalism, it was the best thing that happened to me as a writer. Challenging me at every turn, Professor Thrasher created assignments forcing you to think critically about the most taboo subject: death. With the midterm being an obituary and the final focusing on death, this class has developed me as a writer more than any class I have taken in my life. If you have the opportunity to take this class or are considering taking it, I could not encourage you more to add this class to your shopping cart and enroll in it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I have mixed reactions to this course. First, we covered a lot of material and Dr. Thrasher showed us many sources that I'm really glad I came across in this class. I enjoyed reading his book and understanding feature writing techniques more broadly than just magazine or newspaper style. However, I found the content extremely heavy. I think I burned out in this class early on because I didn't know how to separate my feelings about some of the readings from the work I had to do. The contents of this class are definitely hard to deal with at times, so I would advise taking care of yourself and allowing yourself breaks when working on readings and assignments. Still, I'm glad I took the course. I learned quite a bit, improved my thinking and writing, and enjoyed the small class environment. Journalists deal with these topics very often, so I'm glad I had a course teaching me how to write about them clearly and thoughtfully."
jour,jour,321,winter,Mei-Ling Hopgood,5.55,5.27,5.18,4.80,5.36,6.64,"This is a great class for anyone interested in magazine journalism! Professor Hopgood truly wants to help you improve your writing, and the complete/incomplete grading system relieves the stress of making mistakes. While the mini assignments at the beginning of the quarter can be tedious, they help familiarize you with magazine structures and styles before getting into your final project, which you can (hopefully) pitch and use in your portfolio."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned A LOT from this course. Like many Medill classes, it can get stressful getting interviews and finishing drafts by deadline. But I really enjoyed that we got the entire quarter to work on our final feature story because it allowed us to form relationships with our sources and change directions if needed. Definitely my favorite Medill class so far. Prof. Hopgood is wonderful and brought in a bunch of guest speakers from the magazine world. Important to note though is that there are a lot of smaller assignments throughout the quarter that can take time from working on the final feature."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class starts off more fast–paced, then slows down, but I prefer this as I'm more preoccupied with classes toward the end of the quarter. We had the amazing opportunity to speak with many journalists in different beats and news networks. I also really appreciated being able to spend around four weeks solely on our final feature, submitting four drafts total. It was useful being able to strengthen our work since we also received feedback on our pitches to possibly get our hard work published. Only thing is the class had lots of readings, but most relate to topics we focus on in certain assignments and some are just additional optional ones."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was a lot of work but rewarding at the end with a 1000–2000 word feature as the final. I loved the new grading scale she used based on getting a complete, incomplete or complete +. It took a lot of pressure off of being perfect when turning things in but the incentive to do well was still there. Overall, I grew as a writer for sure, and I'm glad I put in the work for this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great class if you enjoy what you're writing about. You spend most of the quarter working on a long feature story and you have complete control over the topic, which is great if you have a good idea of what you want to do going into it. The deadline to figure out what you're writing about comes up quickly and it's a tough class if you pick a challenging story/write about something you're not that interested in. Between work on the final story and other weekly assignments, work for this class adds up – you'll get a lot out of it if you take it during a light quarter. If you take it during a quarter when you have a lot going on, it can be hard to keep up. You're encouraged to try to get your final piece published which is great, but not if you don't write about a topic you like and have a lot of time to devote to it."
,,,,,,,,,,,I learned the more in this class than any other journalism class I’ve taken. This class is a LOT of work and hard to keep up with at times– basically two writing assignments per class. Sometimes class was even cancelled just so we could work. But paid off in the end and genuinely feel like a better journalist afterwards. Professor Hopgood gives so much feedback and really invests in and cares about students. Take this class if you are not afraid to put in work and want to grow as a journalist.
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof. Hopgood is great and it's nice that you get to spend an extended amount of time reporting for your final project. Reminded me what I like about journalism.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course had a lot of busy assignments that distracted from the final feature. For the latter half of the quarter, you work on several drafts of a final feature story. It was good to learn the process of working on a project for a long time but I think the other assignments distracted from the final story. The class was also hybrid which made it hard to stay focused on the tasks we were doing."
jour,jour,321,spring,Douglas Foster,4.40,4.10,4.10,3.90,4.20,8.60,"If you are deciding between this and the Magazine Editing course, take that one. The class is essentially structured the same way and uses all the same reading materials, but this course takes up so much time. Expectations of in–person reporting and in–depth work getting to know your sources are hard to meet as a student with other things going on. The assignments were actually helpful in building magazine writing skills, but the in–class time was often repetitive and unnecessary. This class might be better structured as an independent study or something where you don't need to attend lectures, but get more time to report and write and check in with the professor and other students occasionally. You can tell the readings from the class have been reused year by year, often focusing on articles that came out in 2020 or around then. There were also times we looked at the same materials multiple times throughout the course when the professor presumably forgot we had seen them before. The best part of the class was the reporting and writing done outside of class, and the class time left me bored and exasperated after hearing the same things over and over."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course! I already had an interest in feature writing, and it was great to have so much freedom in our topics. I appreciate Prof. Foster's openness to ideas and support throughout the process. You really get out of it what you put in."
,,,,,,,,,,,Amazing class. Made me excited to interview people. Will recommend 10/10
,,,,,,,,,,,not a good class.
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is a really good hands–on experience on how to build a long feature. You work on a feature bit by bit which makes it really manageable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is good! Really allows you to dive into one particular story and make the most of 10 weeks spent learning and reporting on it. It's a little disorganized (sometimes to Prof Foster will makes requests through Canvas just 2 hours before class), but the major assignments are straightforward. I enjoyed it because it feels both more manageable than other Medill classes, but also feels like it gives more depth. I think the actual learning was a little lacking—I feel like I got a sense of what was good storytelling and how to recognize certain elements of narrative but it was not that instructive. Which is maybe just how it goes for most Medill courses. Peer editing groups were really good."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'd never really considered the notion I might be interested in magazine writing before this class–– in fact, I probably couldn't even really describe what it was. But this class literally made me want to pursue magazine writing professionally. I've never felt so encouraged to be creative in any other Medill classes. Prof. Foster cares so much about his students and wants you to experiment and push yourself. Would highly recommend to anyone with an itch for creative writing!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"this is like 201–1 in a different font, only difference is it's a little more in–person reporting based. basically if you want to write feature stories about a topic of your choosing, this is for you. otherwise, there's not a whole lot of structure there. like it's basically 4 hours a week for you to be supported in pursuing a journalism project and get feedback from your peers, but there is barely a lecture component. i thought we spent a little too much time in peer groups, but idk other people seemed to enjoy it. also final story is 2500 words which is kind of brutal. i think you just really have to be dedicated to your writing and passionate about your topic to get anything out of this class."
jour,jour,323,fall,Craig Duff,5.33,5.00,4.67,5.33,5.00,7.66,"I learned so so much in this course and it seriously changed my career trajectory. While it is challenging, it is just as rewarding and Prof. Duff is always so willing to help anyone! There are also super cool guest speakers and you learn so many cool techniques with all the programs. A must–take!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"professor duff knows his way around technology, a refreshing change from some other medill classes. this is an adobe premiere tutorial class, but professor duff gives you the opportunity to go above and beyond in producing your story. as with all the other medill classes, start stuff early and you'll be fine. and remember, editing video takes a lot longer than you think!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great great class. Professor Duff is the NICEST (seriously) and besides giving really targeted feedback to help me improve, he was always bringing in cookies and snacks to brighten our days. Many notable guest speakers were brought in, and he introduced us to new forms of editing and software that I had never used before. You get to choose what you report about so the course always stays focused on your own interests which I really enjoyed."
,,,,,,,,,,,COST ALERT – Didn't have to buy anything extra for this class which is always a plus :)

jour,jour,333,fall,Mei-Ling Hopgood),5.86,5.86,5.14,5.43,5.71,8.14,"This class was really helpful if you want to use Spanish throughout your career in journalism; I feel a lot more comfortable now reporting and writing in Spanish, plus you walk away with articles written completely in Spanish, which is also a nice plus."
,,,,,,,,,,,"love this class! i was scared to take it because my spanish isn't very formal, but mei–ling was super understanding that we have different levels of fluency. also it's a fairly small class so it's very casual/conversational. projects and readings cannot be left to the last minute because then it would be overwhelming, but the readings are actually really interesting and you low–key dont need them all for classes (it's just helpful)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Fun class and good for people studying Spanish in addition to journalism. You get lots of opportunities to practice your Spanish in class (if you want) or for assignments. Prof. Hopgood is very understanding and wants you to succeed. Readings aren't too bad, guest speakers are fun."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is an excellent class to take if you're interested in reporting in Spanish! Prof. Hopgood is really thoughtful and helpful– she gives very detailed feedback and helps you learn how to approach an editor and pitch in addition to creating great stories. Workload is a bit heavier than other JOUR classes, but the non–reporting assignments are interesting and helpful for creating your final story– they don't feel like busywork. Highly recommend, even if you're not planning to do JR Argentina!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is great! If you are interested in reporting on Latine communities and getting better at interviewing in Spanish, this is the best course to take. All of the articles and podcasts we consumed for homework were very helpful in understanding the broader Latine media sphere as well as who it is targeting and how to treat Latine populations as non–monolithic. The assignments themselves were a good mix of Spanish and English, and very much aligned with the practice of bilingual journalism."
jour,jour,342,fall,Zach Wise,5.67,5.25,4.88,4.63,5.67,4.50,"Knight Lab Studio is amazing as always. I had the chance to design something that I'm personally interested in with guidance from Zach and Joe, who were extremely helpful in providing suggestions and direction while giving our team the freedom to define our project."
,,,,Zach Wise,,,,,,,"The course is pretty flexible and requires the student team to develop their own structure, especially for more open–ended projects. Some teams have more resources than others, but making your goals into digestible tasks is helpful. The work flow between each week can be pretty variable, but it's generally manageable. Some groups worked with clients, which gives them good connections and experience working in a professional context. The professors are well informed and, if you're struggling with a technical issue they can't solve, they can direct you to someone else who is better suited for the task. This class is all teamwork, so the group dynamic is super important."
,,,,Zach Wise,,,,,,,LOVE JOE !!!! such a sweet and supportive person. had such a good first experience with the lab
,,,,Zach Wise,,,,,,,Awesome class! You and your group have flexibility to explore areas that you think is interesting.
,,,,Zach Wise,,,,,,,"This was a really cool opportunity to learn in a different way, which was largely successful, but I think the class needed just a little more structure."
,,,,Zach Wise,,,,,,,"I loved this class. Our group got close and had a blast, the work outside of class was minimal, and Joe and Zac were just so amazing, I feel grateful to know them."
jour,jour,342,winter,Zach Wise,4.75,5.17,5.00,4.67,5.00,5.00,"Although everyone's experience will differ depending on what project you work on, personally I thought the Knight Lab was a fantastic class! It's a largely self–driven class, where goals and plans are set ad managed by you and your team, while the instructors take a very hands–off approach. However, they are there if you need it and are a great resource! Joe, Jeremy and Zack are all wonderful and more than willing to help wherever it is needed."
,,,,Zach Wise,,,,,,,"At the same time, I thought this course could have been more directed, just in terms of what assignment expectations were. I liked the freedom to explore that this class offered, but it could be stressful at times to not know exactly what was expected of us. Still, the professors were very approachable and open to questions. So when we weren't sure, it was always an option to ask for clarification."
,,,,Zach Wise,,,,,,,fun class. met very nice & diverse group of people. zach is a really nice guy. highly recommend.
,,,,Zach Wise,,,,,,,"Unique class –– no instruction, you're basically just working with your group, which can be challenging if you get stuck with people who don't want to work/put effort in. It felt like the professors were kind of just making up our guidelines as we went, which made it challenging to be able to work as a team and know what was expected of us. They didn't really tell us what they expected from our final deliverable until like halfway through the quarter, and sometimes they would give us advice that directly contradicted advice they had given us the day before. But besides that, I feel like I really grew in my ability to work with a team and think outside the box/towards innovation, which is valuable. Profs also have a ton of cool contacts that we got to interview a few of, which was a cool experience."
jour,jour,342,spring,Zach Wise,5.43,5.40,5.30,5.50,5.57,6.20,"A really awesome course. You get out what you put in – if you want to put a lot of effort into your project and produce something really cool, you can definitely do that. If you'd rather make a bare minimum viable product, that's also a possibility. Either way, the pressure of the grades is taken off for the most part which lets you focus on your work."
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a good experience overall. The class gives you a lot of freedom to work on and develop a vision for your project. I would recommend Knight Lab!
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this class a lot! It was group project based and very hands–on, and I felt like I could steer the project in the direction I was most interested in. I did a decent amount of work outside of class, but was able to manage the workload so I didn't have to do too much work on weeks I had a lot of work in other classes."
,,,,,,,,,,,One of the best classes I've taken. The hands off studio style is great. We get to work on a project and make a lot of decisions on our own. Professors just guide us and give us support when necessary and monitor progress. The people in this class are also amazing. Definitely recommend this class. There is a reasonable time commitment but nothing too excessive. You have to work hard but its definitely a safe space for growth and learning without added / unnecessary stress or busy work.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Knight Lab courses are super interesting. I loved the project I was working on, but I didn't love my team, so I think that tainted my experience. Nonetheless, it's a super cool program that allows you to have a nice change–of–pace from tradition classes."

,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this course if you can with Gilbert and Birnbaum. They have amazing ideas for projects and allow you to code them near–independently with your team.

,,,,,,,,,,,"Great project–based class, take it with Prof Birnbaum and Prof Gilbert! Each group is assigned a project that has to do with AI and Media, then you work on it through–out the quarter. One downside is you can't choose your project group"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great professor team, though this isn't really a ""learning"" class in terms of lectures and readings. It's entirely student driven. Your group determines your experience. It's great especially for journalism students trying to get product experience. But they key to being a good group member is anticipating your CS students' needs and making life easier for them –– they'll be doing a lot of the heavy duty coding. That's not an opportunity to slack off (and sometimes I felt unfairly sharing the work as a journalism student). Overall, enjoyed exploring AI and journalism –– it's an extremely relevant class and one Medill desperately needs to have a place in the conversation."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is cool in theory, but the work is very separate between journalism and CS majors. I would have hoped that it was more integrated and both got to learn more about the other subject. It is not a demanding class time–wise though, although class feels very long sometimes as every week is either group presentations or work time. I think this class would benefit from having more structure."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course! It was fairly low–stress, but you learn a lot at the same time."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall it's a pretty good class to get experience building software with real world applications, but there's no instruction so you have to teach yourself everything. The amount of work will definitely depend on what project you get assigned and how experienced at programming the other people in your group are."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was entirely project–based. Other than the first class, there was no lecture. Classtime was just for us to present the current progress on our project or to work on our project. I feel like I didn't really learn anything new from the course, but it was still fun working on the project."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Class is basically just a platform to work on a project related to AI and journalism, pretty self directed after the profs define the original project concept. Not many hard deadlines, basically just have to convince the professors you are making progress each week with several demos throughout the quarter. I really enjoyed this class as a chance to just work on a cool project, but don't go in expecting the profs to teach you much directly about coding"

,,,,Peter Slevin,,,,,,,"This is one of the best Medill classes (and Northwestern classes overall) I have taken. Slevin is truly just the best– he is kind, charismatic, unbelievably knowledgeable and genuinely cares about his students. The highlight of this class is definitely the weekend reporting trip (we went to Wisconsin before the midterm elections). Each week has a loose theme/focus and Prof. Slevin assigns great journalistic work that is genuinely engaging and relevant. The reading load can at times be heavy, but you can get by in this class doing maybe 10% of the readings, although you'll want to do more because they are so interesting. Don't be intimidated by the 3–hour course length; the class is mostly discussion–based so it flies by and Prof. Slevin brings in really great guest speakers (we got to speak with former CNN reporter John Harwood!) almost every week. He also gives breaks every hour which helps the class fly by. Slevin takes a super flexible approach to the class. For the reporting trip, he basically dropped us in Wisconsin for a weekend and gave us three days to chase any story we wanted to, in any format we wanted to, and file by the end of the week. We were given a few rental cars courtesy of Medill (plus free hotel rooms) and trusted to spend our days productively. We were basically on our own all weekend except for nightly optional dinners (also courtesy of Medill) where we got to debrief with Slevin (and Jaz from Medill advising who is the best!!) and an optional class trip to see Obama speak in Milwaukee. Slevin takes the same approach with assignments: other than the first two assignments (a journalistic profile and a short academic midterm paper), we were able to pursue the Wisconsin story and the final in any format we wanted – print, audio, video or an academic paper for the final."
,,,,Peter Slevin,,,,,,,"Slevin is not an easy grader but he's also not unreasonably harsh. I found his grading to be harsher on the stories than the papers (which makes considering political feature/profile writing is his bread and butter), and he does give really helpful and thorough feedback. You can definitely get a B+/A– in this class by putting in a decent amount of effort. You'll need to work hard and impress him to get an A, but it's not an infeasible task."
,,,,Peter Slevin,,,,,,,Slevin is awesome and I absolutely loved this course. It was one of my favorite classes I have taken at NU. The trip we took was a once in a life time experience and gave me great insight into the political climate in swing states. I learned a ton about both journalism and politics. Definitely take!
,,,,Peter Slevin,,,,,,,"If you are ever so lucky to take a course with Peter Slevin, you are in for a treat. Peter Slevin has been the most impactful professor of my Northwestern career. He challenges you to think with nuance, assess the facts critically, and write with detailed brevity. Getting to go to Wisconsin during the Midterms was an absolute blast and a fantastic opportunity to get more on–the–ground political reporting experience."
,,,,Peter Slevin,,,,,,,"This was, legitimately, the best course I've taken at Northwestern. Drop EVERYTHING to take any class you can with Peter Slevin. This class was free–flowing, hands–on, and extremely topical in all the best ways. Slevin gets enthusiastic discussion going like no professor I've ever had, and he infuses every class with real–world examples and journalism of every subgenre. The assignments are creative and open–ended, and regardless of your level of interest in politics, this class will leave you more excited to be a journalist than when you started."
jour,jour,353,fall,Peter Slevin,5.57,5.32,5.36,5.27,5.65,5.64,YOU MUST TAKE A CLASS WITH PROFESSOR SLEVIN BEFORE GRADUATING. This class is a hood overall understanding of American Foreign Policy and international relations history. A lot of readings. Class is 2 midterms and a paper midterm consists of 2 essays so it is a bit of work
,,,,,,,,,,,"this was my favorite class that i have taken at NU. Not an easy A, but super interesting. 2 midterm exams (which each had 2 essays + identification paragraphs) and a final research paper on a topic of your choice. midterms were pretty difficult but not much you can prepare for. still, an amazing class and Slevin is the best professor!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was great. Professor Slevin really knew what he was talking about and he did a great job teaching us many different topics regarding foreign policy. As someone who is new to foreign policy, I thought this was a great introduction course. It was also a great Medill class to take if you don't want a reporting class. However, it definitely isn't easy to get an A in this class, so I would just be aware of that. Overall, great course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's a great class if you're heavily interested in international relations, but it is not a beginner–level class. I had never taken an IS class before so I lacked the background knowledge necessary to understand a lot of the topics discussed as Professor Slevin assumes you know a good deal about each of the topics. So essentially I felt like I lacked the basic understanding necessary for the class. But overall it was a good course and I would recommend it if you have a lighter load. Class is made up of discussion posts, 2 exams, and a 12 page paper. There are also A LOT of readings."
,,,,,,,,,,,great class. only take if you are interested in US history.
,,,,,,,,,,,"great course – really interesting topic, manageable workload and a lot to learn"
,,,,,,,,,,,"As overwhelming as they were, I appreciated the exercises that pushed us to generate our own solutions for mega global issues and apply all the principles that we learned. I also really enjoyed the use of clips of speeches, campaign adds, and other kinds of video footage that added texture to the lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enrolled in this course more so to get the credits than out of interest, but I did enjoy it. Professor Slevin was very engaging and I learned quite a bit about the history of US foreign policy. Homework was just readings (many were from NYT or WaPo, which if you don't subscribe to good luck accessing them) and discussion posts, but the final project was a hefty 12 page argumentative paper on literally anything foreign policy related, which may be good or bad depending on who you are. Overall very interesting class, I'm glad I took it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"this course was super interesting!! Slevin is SUCH a great professor and lecturer. my only complaints are there are some readings which feel unnecessary (like misc. news articles) and the lectures can sometimes be not super engaging but that honestly depends on how much effort you put in during class. I learned so so much about American foreign policy history, which is so helpful for understanding current events. wish it was longer so I could learn more! discussion section were always fun and engaging and the assignments throughout the quarter are quite manageable. 2 exams + a final is a lot because there is so much content, but Brian is very responsive and helpful when people have questions. even if you aren't super interested in this topic, you probably will be by the end, and is overall just good information to know to be an informed citizen. be prepared to write a lot though"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I definitely recommend taking this class to anyone interested in foreign affairs, as it is a pretty solid survey and Slevin is one of the profs you'll want to take before graduating. Readings each week were reasonable, with discussion board posts twice throughout the quarter. There were two in person exams that were hand–written but reasonable content–wise. The most difficult thing to stay on top of was a 12–page research paper, because there was little structure, but it's pretty standard for any humanities class paper. The lectures and readings were interesting, and I think the class was worth the workload."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was great! I learned so much and Professor Slevin is really amazing. Though the class is definitely not an easy A it’s definitely passable. I’d say take the class if you want to learn a lot not necessarily if you want to maintain a 4.0 or something like that. There are only a few assignments that make up your grade so it’s really subjective. That being said I really enjoyed this class and you’ll leave the course feeling like you have a good grasp on American power in recent history.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class if you're interested in American foreign policy! My favorite class at Northwestern so far. We have discussed almost all the major conflicts involving the United States since World War II. The class helps not only to find out what happened during various military interventions but also to put yourself in the place of a decision–maker from the government. We also had two amazing guests who really inspired me. Besides, Professor Slevin is amazing, he knows so much and has so many fascinating stories to tell. He was always willing to help and answered all my questions. Our TA, Brian, was very helpful too. Take this class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a pretty solid class. Professor Slevin is wonderful and has a TON of knowledge about international relations and journalism, so I recommend taking this class just to learn from him. Weekly assignments are pretty straight forward – a short discussion post and a few readings to complete before each class. That said, I did not love the evaluation method of the course, as I felt that I did not have adequate time on the midterm and final exams (which were each 80 minutes in class) to complete the two essays and three short answer questions expected of me in a way that fully conveyed my knowledge of the subject. Overall, though, I recommend this class because it was interesting and applicable to current events."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Loved this class! Very interesting content and a reasonable amount of work: discussion posts each week plus two midterms and a final paper. Really more of a political science class than a journalism class, but great for any journalism student who wants a break from reporting."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is an amazing class if you are interested in international affairs or foreign policy. Professor Slevin is an excellent professor and is really helpful in class and in office hours! Genuinely one of my favorite classes I've ever taken at Northwestern. The guest speakers were also incredible.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a challenging and fascinating class unlike any other I've taken at NU. Professor Slevin asked us to give our opinions on major news events like Ukraine and Iran, which was shocking at first but as the course progressed I was able to form more intelligent and strategic responses tot he initially intractable, titular dilemmas."
,,,,,,,,,,,NA
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a helpful primer– or review– of American foreign policy. Professor Slevin is very knowledgeable about this field, and I'd recommend this class to anyone– not just a political science or journalism major. If you're debating between taking an intro to international relations class or this class, I'd take this one– they cover similar material in a smaller class. The readings are a little tedious, but can be skimmed if you have base knowledge coming into the course. There weren't many assignments, and the one paper we did have was very open ended– you could focus on what interests you most. This class is very customizable in my experience."
jour,jour,358,winter,J.A. Adande,3.96,4.12,4.28,3.40,4.04,4.44,"This is a curious class. Adande is an impressive professional, but I can't say it really translates to teaching. His lectures were pretty scattered and not tied to any visuals/presentation, so it was hard to take notes. Each class, everyone posts a question for him on a discussion board, and he selects the questions in order of posting, not thematically. So the first thing we talk about could be thing ""C,"" then back to thing ""A,"" then to ""D,"" then to ""B."" Super hard to take notes, although there wasn't much to take notes for. Interesting material, but there wasn't a ton of endgame to it. The course is manageable day–to–day, and there are no pop quizzes or anything to keep you on your toes. If you have to take media history and like sports, then take this class. The midterm was fair and the final assignment seems like it will be, too."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is a decent way to knock out your 302 requirement. Barely any work and you can just kind of do whatever you want during lecture. The quizzes, however, are actually pretty difficult and based off very specific things he says during lectures which are often near impossible to take notes on and remember – which means it isn't an easy A at all. If you can avoid this course, do so, but if you have to take it, my attitude during the quarter was indifferent at best and strongly annoyed at worst."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was very excited to take this course and while I don’t regret taking it and JA Adande is an incredibly talented journalist, the quizzes were difficult and often included m te rayos not in the readings and the overall course lacked organization."
,,,,,,,,,,,It was fun but also felt unimportant.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class was essentially a Q&A with the students and Adande. There was a midterm exam and final paper, as well as weekly quizzes. The quizzes were the worst part, because they would quiz you on the most obscure minute details of something he said in class. Overall, Adande was very knowledgeable, and I enjoyed hearing his stories, but it didn't super feel like a real class, just like a Q&A."
,,,,,,,,,,,It was nice to have an hour twenty twice a week and just talk about sports. Professor Adande is a cool guy with interesting takes and lots of knowledge and experience. It can get a little boring as there's not much to do during the class
,,,,,,,,,,,"The format of the course is submitting questions in the discussion on Canvas for each lecture, then the professor would answer them during class. There was a Midterm, five multiple choice Quizzes based on the lectures, and a final essay."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you're not interested in sports media, you probably won't get that much out of this class. The weekly readings are really long and dense (sometimes interesting, not always). Weekly quizzes are really specific and often ask about irrelevant facts from the lectures. Prof. Adande has a lot of great industry knowledge, but the way he runs his class is not engaging. He runs it ""like a press conference"" so its almost completely Q&A based – there's no powerpoints or structure to the lecture. Hard to prep for the midterm without really knowing what you are supposed to know. At the end of the day, this class is not HARD, but it is not engaging, nor easy. Not sure what am coming out of this class saying that I learned."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not really a lot of teaching, basically you just do the reading then ask Adande questions about it. I'm a female sports journalist, and there were some times in the class where the way things were taught or discussed felt a little sexist/uncomfortable, and many other girls in the class agreed with me.(it did get better at the end of the quarter, I think someone talked to him about it and I hope he continue to improve it). The weekly quizzes were based on side comments he made, which made them difficult for most people. But overall, it's not a lot of work, an easy A, and the content is interesting. If you're a girl, sit in the front rows & make your voice heard –– this quarter all the girls sat in the back and I wish we would have made more of a presence!! It's an interesting class & if you love sports don't doubt that you belong there!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course was very interesting. However, it was sort of all over the place and I could see how students who aren't interested in sports or who do not come from a sports background would have a hard time following or remaining intrigued by class discussion."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really did not enjoy this. I thought it would explore many facets of the sports world and engage different forms of sports media. It has the opportunity to be such an interesting class, but instead the professor put in no effort, and the course only focused on typical sports like men's basketball and football. There was very little diversity of content. The only interesting part was getting a little history of the evolution of media in general."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Adande structures the class like a press conference so u just submit questions prior to class based on readings and then he answers them in class. as someone who literally knows nothing about sports, I found myself struggling in the class becuase I couldn't always keep up with the lingo and little stuff any sports fan would know or remember. grading was sometimes hard and sometimes easy but there was EC which is nice."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Adande is extremely knowledgeable about sports media, where it's been and where the industry is headed. The readings in this class are largely manageable, but the reading quizzes are very specific and make up a big portion of the grade. All in all, the class may take some getting used to, but it's worthwhile if you have any interest in sports or sports journalism."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course teaches a lot of really cool things about the sports media landscape. I wish there were more lectures, but I found the readings and class discussions very engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't think this class reached my expectations. I chose this class because I really liked Professor Adande's presentation in my 201 class, and I thought it would be more of that. I thought we would really get to hear from Professor Adande's experiences from his illustrious career, but it was just really boring? The class is formatted in a way where 80% of it is just Professor Adande answering our questions, but most of our questions were pretty bad, and I feel like there was a lot more cooler stuff we could've learned if he made more decisions as to what he wanted to talk about. In terms of academic rigor, this class is fine. It's hard to do great in because the reading quizzes are pretty tricky and ask you about pretty specific stuff, but there's not a lot of assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you're a sports person, this course is probably a must. Otherwise, this course might not be for you. The readings for this course can be very interesting but the course overall is not very well–structured with odd forms of assessment. The quizzes are scarce but play a huge role in your grade and lectures can often meander a bit. However, there is definitely still enough interesting content within this course to engage some."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you are not a sports buff/fan, do not take this course. Having very limited prior knowledge of the sports world and the key personalities made the course incredibly difficult because of the learning curve."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Quizzes being 40% of your grade isn't great. It also seemed really difficult to connect with Adande, or really develop a relationship with everyone else I didn't know."
,,,,,,,,,,,"overall good class. Not so difficult, but still interesting. Professor Adande is a good professor. The worst part of the class was actually some of the other students, who were convinced that asking Professor Adande more questions will lead to them getting a job in sports media. Made it difficult for a robust discussion. I found the content interesting, though."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Please do not take this class if you are not already knowledgeable about sports, it will be really hard."
jour,jour,367,fall,Patricia Loew,5.90,5.82,5.27,5.00,5.90,3.73,Love this class. Love Patty. The course was a really positive experience and also the trip to the Oneida reservation was one of the highlights of my Fall quarter.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Best class ever!!!!!! Patty is retiring after this class is over so people cannot take it in the future with her, but this class honestly changed how I view life, so amazing"
,,,,,,,,,,,"this class is incredible. take it if you can! it can't be described in single comment, but it will change the way you view life and how you are in the world moving forward."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is a must if you are in Medill. Reporting on Indigenous communities is vitally important, and this course makes sure you understand how to do so with empathy and understanding of different cultures and customs. Going to the White Corn Cooperative was such a great learning and growing experience and really helped bring theory and practice together."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was the best course I have ever taken at Northwestern. I learned so much not only from the class material but also from Patty and my classmates as people. The Oneida trip changed my life forever in so many ways, and reading Braiding Sweetgrass was so powerful because it taught me about the connection between people and nature. I feel so incredibly lucky that I was able to take this class and I so wish that everyone could experience it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"We had a wonderful, kind professor and an amazing group of passionate, intelligent, unique students."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was one of my favorite classes that I've taken at Northwestern! Patty is an amazing human and a perfect teacher for this class. The trip to the Oneida reservation in Wisconsin was one of the most memorable weekends at my time here at Northwestern and that trip alone made the class. Braiding Sweetgrass is one of the best books ever and I loved the way we integrated it into the class. The classes themselves were relaxed and I felt super comfortable asking questions, engaging in discussion, etc. Overall amazing (although slightly easy and wish I learned challenged a little bit more) and highly recommend (even though Patty won't be at Northwestern anymore :( )"
,,,,,,,,,,,"AMAZING CLASS. This class actually changed my life and that's not an exaggeration. The field trip to Oneida was one of the most eye–opening experiences I have ever had and truly changed my perspective on how I want to live my life. Patty is an amazing professor, so kind and genuinely cares about her students. I will forever be grateful for everything this class taught me."
jour,jour,367,spring,Reynaldo Morales Cardenas,5.18,5.09,5.27,4.09,5.36,3.00,"I really liked this class overall. Reynaldo wanted us to learn a lot about a topic most of us had never gotten any exposure to. Every class was pretty chill – he just showed us different readings/videos and we discussed them. The trip to Menominee, though it was definitely a bit disorganized, was a great experience and a really unique way to learn firsthand about some of the issues we had talked about in class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class. Prof. Morales is extremely kind and creates an environment where learning is the priority over simply just getting a good grade. Learning materials included a nice mix of readings, videos and movies. The workload was light, and the only assignments were 5 short responses throughout the quarter, one class presentation about one of the readings and a final reported projects. The class included a trip to the Menominee Reservation in WI which was a wonderful experience. This is important for every budding journalist to take, so that they know how to cover Native American issues in a constructive, rather than extractive way."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very relaxed course where you get out what you put in. Low–key, one of the better media history classes, in my opinion. And you get to travel and there's no reporting expectation on the trip. Professor is supportive."
,,,,,,,,,,,Disorganized class but easy and fun. Field trip was really fun. I truly learned a lot and enjoyed this course.
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a great medill course to take if you need an easy course that you still learn a lot in! The field trip to the Menominee Reservation really opened my eyes to the Native American culture and was such a unique experience that you cannot get without taking this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class offers a one of a kind opportunity to visit an indigenous reservation, which I found incredibly special and informative. Professor Morales wants to see his students succeed, and has a wealth of stories, relationships and experiences that truly makes him an expert on this subject."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is very simple and the topic is important and interesting, so definitely not a bad one to take. It’s pretty disorganized in terms of the trip schedule and itinerary and the homework assignments, but all in all it’s pretty low effort and Professor Moralss really cares about your learning and appreciating the content."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Morales is a super supportive and understanding professor, and he has a lot of passion for the topic. This class involves a trip to Wisconsin to the Menominee nation which was a lovely opportunity. Though the class feels a bit disorganized at times, he is flexible with deadlines. You do some readings and one week you do a presentation about that week's readings for a chunk of your grade, write 5 short reflection essays throughout the quarter, and do a final project (journalism/multimedia piece) about a topic of your choosing. I actually learned so much about a really important topic so I'd reccomend it"
jour,jour,370,fall,Benjamin Holden,4.00,3.88,4.71,4.88,3.88,5.35,"This has been my least favorite course at Medill so far. Prof. Holden is all over the place in his lectures and his exams are extremely hard with lots of questions having never been discussed in class. The end of the quarter is also extremely rushed and he tries to fit the same curriculum he taught at a semester university into the quarter system, making for a very disorganized class. The professor also gives very little instruction on many assignments leaving students confused. Unless you want to be a lawyer, I would take this class with a different professor."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed this class. Anyone somewhat interested in law will get something out of this class. Professor Holden is very knowledgeable on the subject and is very good at keeping the class attentive and interested in what he has to say.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I don't know why this class is required for Medill. We had to memorize the first amendment and the requirements for government restrictions on commercial speech. I have no idea how that's going to make me a better journalist. This class is very pre–law vibes. If you want to go into law, you'll think this is super interesting. If you don't want to go into law, you'll just feel like you're in your Legally Blonde era. Ben is a good lecturer, this class wasn't unbearably boring and he actually made you feel proud of yourself for learning stuff. He does cold–call though, which was fine for me, but I know that was pretty anxiety–inducing for a lot of my classmates. Also, it was a 9 am but attendance was still graded, which was tough for me. Overall, the class isn't horrible."
,,,,,,,,,,,it was certainly a law class! the media and ethics in question. prof does so much cold calling and does not explain these legal concepts — this class being probably the first time many of us are learning about these concepts mind you — very well and treats this class like some twisted version of a law school class? being in class was really difficult — just watching the prof call on people and squeeze a very specific answer out of them without telling us what he really wanted was hard to watch/experience. also the readings being whole court cases that are sometimes over a hundred pages is quite unreasonable and useless like we didn't even get into some cases some days. tldr; idk how this is a class on *media* law and ethics? the lectures themselves are really hard to get through but the work outside of class is pretty manageable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Holden is definitely knowledgable in this subject area, but that doesn't translate to good teaching. His ""Socratic"" method really just involves picking on one or two students and questioning them throughout the entire class period or cold calling people, which facilitated more anxiety than understanding. We did not learn much ethics at all, and many of the cases we learned about just felt random and unapplicable. He treats this like a pre–law class even though most students aren't going into law. Lectures felt all over the place and dragged on, and made it really difficult to develop any understanding or curiosity about the cases at all. This could've been a class that taught a lot but there was zero enjoyment at all. This really felt like a ten week–long chore."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Holden's section of this course was incredibly difficult. There was always over 100 pages of reading for every class, and he utilized the Socratic method like you'd see in law school. At the end of the quarter you do a Moot Court that consists of a 5–7 page law brief which is written in a group (this was really difficult) and then have to actually perform the Moot court, which is all worth 1/3 of your grade. A week later, he gives a final which is another 1/3 of your grade. While the content was interesting and I learned a lot, I didn't totally understand the direct application to Medill. The class was more in range for pre–law students."
,,,,,,,,,,,"this course was honestly not what i imagined it would be at all. we delve deeply into the first amendment, but into topics that don't always relate to media law. actually, most of the class is not related to media law, and will probably not apply to my career as a journalist in the future. the workload feels way too intensive for an introductory media law class, as we would have to read multiple dense cases before classes, and be quizzed on it in class with little to no explanation. the class could truly be 10 minutes long but the professor drags it out by asking many tedious questions that only he knows the answer to"
,,,,,,,,,,,"prof holden takes this class very seriously – like, you will be taught as if you are in law school and held to similar standards when responding to questions (which he will cold call for if no one responds). i think being in this class was detrimental to my mental health but i'm weirdly glad i took it (call it stockholm syndrome if you must). prof holden is obviously knowledgeable about the first amendment and has a lot of experience in the law field. however as someone not even remotely interested in (or familiar with) the first amendment i struggled for a bit. IF YOU STUDY YOU CAN ACE THE EXAMS. HE IS A VERY FAIR AND LENIENT GRADER. IN–CLASS EXPERIENCE IS STRESSFUL BUT VERY MANAGEABLE."
,,,,,,,,,,,Holden knows what he is talking about. His background as a lawyer allows him to give insight into what is realistic within the scope of media ethics. This class is chill but you have to study for tests. Other than that do the homework which is just 2 hours of reading a week and you will get an A.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Boy – where do I even start with this class. Just to preface, I (and I assume pretty much everyone else) only took this class solely because of the Medill Journalism degree requirement. I'm so glad it's over/near the end because I wanted to jump off this crazy roller coaster after about the first two weeks of the quarter. I concede that Professor Holden is a very knowledgeable person about the class content (given he's taught it at UNevada Reno and UIUC) and is extremely passionate about it. He is also very willing to help outside of class during office hours – it's just a shame that I wanted to use them all the time. I'm generally confused that the class is called ""Media Law and Ethics"" because roughly 60–75% of the content we were taught did not relate directly to journalists or applicably relate to journalists. It was also annoying that this class generally felt like a law school class, but none of us knew that heading in and just got more irritated and had to put up with it as the quarter went on. We learned a ridiculous number of Supreme Court cases and tried doing Moot Court, which was kind of a dumpster fire because the students were thrown into it fairly blind with little reference of how it is supposed to go or work. He just basically assumed we had all done debate or mock trial before in high school so we could figure it out on our own – but this is not the case!!! Most of Holden's lectures followed a pattern where he explained so fast that he simply just forgot what it was like learning it for the first time – he needs to realize that this is pretty much the first time for us students learning about this content, and that the quality of class topic discussion points are more important than the quantity! Ironically enough, he is actually a pretty fair and generous grader with manageable quizzes and exams despite the chaos of his lectures and general course setup. I hope he adjusts his course for the future because right now his content might be suitable for a semester schedule, but it's too hectic to pack into the quarter system. A metaphor for this is like someone bringing enough paint for filling Lake Michigan to try painting the Rock with. The paint represents the course content and the Rock represents the student trying to learn the content: students will learn a lot in this class, but they will also fail to learn so much more – and there's a good chance that the content won't even stick for very long. I don't think Matthewson is a much better alternative professor overall, but yeah this class ain't it. Hopefully Holden can at least take these first CTECs he's had at NU and improve the course for future students. Otherwise, ""Good Luck Charlie"""
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Holden is the best! He really cares about students learning and doing well in the class rather than trying to burry us in work. I had a great time learning about the First Amendment.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I wish we discussed a little bit more how media ethics are involved. We rarely discussed that, and thought that was very important. It felt at times like an AP Gov course and less so as something specific to journalism and how it relates to the law."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course is all about First Amendment cases with some interesting case studies. There was a midterm, final and moot court simulation. There is some teamwork and reading ""quizzes"" (usually for attendance purposes). It is pretty manageable and informati"
jour,jour,370,fall,Joseph Mathewson,3.81,3.57,4.48,4.14,3.48,4.39,"I do think that I learned information in this class that will be really useful in my career, such as how to file a FOIA request and the kinds of legal risks that a journalist might face over the course of their career. There were several engaging guest speakers as well. That being said, class time sometimes felt overly long and repetitive –– it was often difficult to stay engaged."
,,,,Joseph Mathewson,,,,,,,"Mathewson is someone who isn’t very well–versed in technology and the current teaching methods. There were a lot of hiccups along the way, but if as long as you read, you really don’t have to do anything else for this class. The reading sometimes can be dry and long, but that’s all Mathewson wants you to do."
,,,,Joseph Mathewson,,,,,,,"This course is one you really just have to take to get it over with, but that's really disappointing because its such an important topic. The course is Media Law and Ethics, but really you could cut the title off after law because we spent maybe 3 days max on ethics. Ethics in today's journalism are so important, but are glossed over in this course I think because Professor Mathewson does not understand modern ethics. He has a full comprehensive understanding of the law, which is why the course solely focuses on that, but even then I've never been less able to pay attention in a class than I am in this one. I also find it really frustrating when a professor requires you to purchase a book that they wrote."
,,,,Joseph Mathewson,,,,,,,"I did not enjoy this class. There are so many interesting questions of ethics in journalism today, from social media to politics, but this class didn't touch on any of them. It really is just a law class. The assignments are graded with little rhyme or reason."
,,,,Joseph Mathewson,,,,,,,Professor Mathewson basically draws everything from his own book so just quote him directly in your assignments instead of thinking critically and he'll give you a great grade. Otherwise he'll fail you.
,,,,Joseph Mathewson,,,,,,,"Unless you're interested in the subject, this class can be pretty boring, but since it's required for Journalism majors, taking it with Professor Mathewson isn't bad. The work is minimal (though he can be a hard grader) and the lectures are straightforward, and he's really enthusiastic about the subject and his students. You could get by without reading the required portions of the textbook, but it's definitely helpful to keep up during lectures."
,,,,Joseph Mathewson,,,,,,,Honestly a very interesting class. Short essays every week that were genuinely interesting to write and issues to think about. Professor Mathewson is really nice and very available to help.
,,,,Joseph Mathewson,,,,,,,This is an important course. I also enjoyed reading the different legal case studies. I loved the broad range of guest speakers.
,,,,Joseph Mathewson,,,,,,,"This class is a Medill requirement so you have to take it if you're in Medill, but I highly recommend taking it with Joe Mathewson. He's so sweet and intelligent. Sometimes class can be a little boring, but there really isn't too much work besides weekly writing assignments that make up the majority of your grade and a take–home virtual open–note final."
,,,,Joseph Mathewson,,,,,,,"Mathewson is really nice and cares about the subject, but the class can get a bit boring and grading sometimes feels arbitrary."
,,,,Joseph Mathewson,,,,,,,The case studies are interesting to learn about but the class is not engaging whatsoever. Make sure you buy the textbook!
,,,,Joseph Mathewson,,,,,,,"The class was ok and I learned so much about media law and journalist ethics. The speakers were very engaging and knowledgable about the material. The professor was a little difficult to get feedback from as he does not always clearly communicate his expectations or his feedback, even in office hours. But he is very receptive to emails, which is good."
,,,,Joseph Mathewson,,,,,,,"I thought this class was pretty boring. Most people who are not interested in learning a lot of specific laws, statutes, and cases etc. will likely find it boring too. For Medill students, this is just one of those required courses that you have to do."
,,,,Joseph Mathewson,,,,,,,"This class is incredibly boring but it's required for Medill so you just need to get through it. The guest speakers are interesting and the content is important to learn, but I was so disappointed by how Prof. Matthewson taught it. He didn't use powerpoint slides until week five, he had a lot of difficulties using zoom and he overall is just not very good at engaging the class. Attendance is required though, so most people just used class time to do work for other classes. It's relatively easy to do well as long as you read his textbook, but I dreaded going to his class because it just felt like a waste of time."
jour,jour,370,winter,Joseph Mathewson,4.47,4.17,4.60,4.20,3.83,4.20,This class is really good for aspiring journalists in terms of what rights they have in any type of legal setting. It also helped us think critically about the relationship between ethics and law and emphasizing the ethics we should always follow.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is by far the WORST class I've taken at Medill! The fact that this is still a required class is criminal! It is so outdated, boring, and inapplicable to any form of journalism that isn't news media. It's not hard, but it is by far the dullest class I've ever sat through. In addition, Prof Mathewson makes you buy HIS book for the class which... feels a bit scammy, and he speaks so quietly you can't even hear him. The class is based off weekly writing assignments that are just hypothetical scenarios, while writing them I realized how much I would never use any information in this class! I did feel like I was on a trip to the past with this class since it seems like it hasn't changed at all since the 90s, fun little nostalgia trip, right? Jokes aside, you have to take this class as a medill student, there's no getting around it, but I was super productive filling out internship applications during it so it was good for something... right?"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class involves a set of readings (including the bought textbook, which he wrote) each week with a short essay (about 400 words) assignment due Monday morning. The essays and one quiz are worth 60% of the grade, 30% is a final, and 10% is attendance/participation. The essays are straightforward, applying the law/ethical theory from the textbook to a scenario, so if you submit the essays, participate some, and prepare for the open–note 2 hour take–home final, then you're set. I think the concepts and even the essays were interesting, and there were also guest speakers. Prof. Matthewson very clearly cares about his students and is really passionate about the topic, but the lectures weren't the most engaging, though he was always willing to have office hours to discuss something if you were super interested. He is a sweet professor and the class is pretty manageable."
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof. Matthewson makes Media Law and Ethics pretty interesting with interactive weekly assignments that allow you to show what you learned in class. He is very knowledgeable and kind but be cautioned that he grades very specifically and somewhat harshly.
,,,,,,,,,,,i loved this class!! joe is clearly qualified and enthusiastic about the subject and i learned so much.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Law isn't always the most interesting, but this course did help me learn the necessary material I need to be a journalist and hopefully not be sued."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Fine enough! Why the lecture isn't super engaging, I feel like the assignments build pretty naturally off the book and it's pretty clear what you're learning and supposed to do. A good class to just turn in your one weekly assignment and then zone out for the rest of the time."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Yet another Medill required class that was far from ideal. Professor Mathewson is sweet and incredibly knowledge, but he's also older, and it can be frustrating when his point of view is so different than the fresh perspectives of students in the class. The course isn't hard per se, but Mathewson can be a harsh grader. The guests were lovely, but I could have lived without this course, and I personally did not learn many new things about the law."
,,,,,,,,,,,I liked this class a lot! Joe is awesome and made the class as entertaining as possible. The guest speakers were amazing and the assignments were very reasonable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The best part about this course is how assignments are broken up. The assignment right before each week relates to that week's lecture, so you have some knowledge going in. Also, there's no stressful midterms"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Everyone has to take it regardless, it's not a huge time commitment (weekly 300 word assignments) but they require really specific answers. class is boring"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I appreciated Professor Matthewson's efforts of bringing in outside speakers. However, many of his own lectures are really dry. The speakers, though interesting, are not very helpful in explaining the legal concepts. It also feels like a legal history class of media. We rarely talk about current media legal cases."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Do the assignments on time!!! Your grade will be penalized if not. This class is what it is, it's not too difficult to get through but I personally found very little of interest in it and it was just something I had to get through."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is a pretty easy one to complete. Prof. Mathewson is a sweetheart and his enthusiasm for the subject is actually pretty infectious. The assignments are easy and straightforward if you listen to his feedback and the final exam is pretty straightforward as well if you do well on the assignments. Guest lecturers are really cool and I highly recommend asking them as many questions as you can.
,,,,,,,,,,,I think the aspects of the class that applied to me were informative.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is okay, but really important to take. I'm not that interested in law so it wasn't always super interesting to me but the textbook was really clear and helpful. Not that much work."
,,,,,,,,,,,It was interesting to work with Supreme Court cases as this merge my interest in law and journalism which was something important to me.
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is a great intro to Media Law! Matthewson is a great professor and very knowledgeable about the field. The weekly assignments are low–risk but keep you on track and help you understand the material! Matthewson also just truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is interesting in theory, but the professor is just not very helpful in explaining topics and the lectures are tough to get through. He clearly is a smart individual who cares about this topic, but it is really difficult to connect with him"
,,,,,,,,,,,"It’s required, don’t take it with Professor Mathewson if you don’t have to."
jour,jour,370,spring,Benjamin Holden,5.19,5.06,5.35,5.19,5.31,6.99,"I really enjoyed this course because of the way Professor Holden taught it. It could easily be very boring and get nothing out of it, but I walked away learning virtually everything I need to know about the First Amendment in a critical manner."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class really did change the way I think about the law and its application to our lives, not only as journalists, but as citizens in general. Holden has a distinctive way of teaching that's up front and sometimes brutally honest, but he genuinely cares about his students and will help you out if you're willing to put in the effort. I would recommend taking the class with friends because there are a handful of group assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not a bad class. Holden is a good professor and seems to try to incorporate feedback into his teaching methods. Some stuff felt a little rushed, but that's just because there's so much to cover and Holden used to teach at semester schools, so he had to cut a lot down. Grading is based on class attendance/attendance quizzes, a midterm, a Moot Court brief and optional Moot court argument, and a final paper. Really not bad in terms of work, just basically need to skim case summaries for every class, take notes in class, and study for the midterm to do well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"INCREDIBLE. ONE OF MY FAVORITE CLASSES I'VE TAKEN AT NORTHWESTERN!! Professor Holden is an incredible Professor –– he is brilliant, a fantastic speaker, and made every class engaging. I wasn't expecting it to be as law–heavy as it was but I really liked it. It even made me consider a career in law. Be prepared to participate a lot. He cold calls, but it was never in a scary way –– it forces you to be present. I learned so much in the class and would 100% recommend. Please take this class with Holden you won't regret it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There will be inevitably be some CTECs that complain about this course because it's a Medill requirement. If you put even a little effort into the material, you will learn so much about law and its applicability to the media. Court cases of a certain topic are assigned each day to read (you can do summaries or the entire case, depending on your interest) and class time is structured around discussion of the readings. Professor Holden was clearly invested in the material and did a fantastic job at provoking good conversation and comparative thinking."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was really challenging but excellent. I wish the class were maybe a little smaller or we'd had time to discuss some arguments more at length. We had to speed through lots of topics because of how much we were trying to fit in. But overall this is one of the best classes I've taken at Northwestern, and it made me feel more equipped to take on journalism work, as well as pursue law school."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course. While it did challenge me, I did learn a lot and retained a lot of content from the course. I appreciated the discussions that Professor Holden fostered in class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As an international student, I was very disappointed with the way Professor Holden taught this class. I felt that he did not take into account that many of us are not from the US, or had never learned about the First Amendment in our lives, and I honestly thought that I was at a disadvantage because of that the whole quarter. Also, many want to practice international journalism, and this class ONLY spoke about US law. Also, I felt that most of the cases he taught were interesting but did not have absolutely anything to do with journalism, I would have enjoyed having a class that is specifically about media law and not about the First Amendment. During class, Professor Holden would give out ""extra points"" to people who would answer random questions, and I felt like this took away my motivation to learn because I was thinking more about the points I earned and the grades I got than in actually learning the information. Also, he called out names in class so be prepared to answer everything. I noticed that he sometimes treated many students differently and had his ""favorites"". I think Professor Holden is very very smart, and I did learn in this class, but I did not like this class, the way he taught, and I would change so many things about the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Holden made me want to become a lawyer! The class is hard work, but I really enjoyed it. He has high expectations for his students but he really motivated me to work hard."
,,,,,,,,,,,"At first, I was really skeptical of taking this class with Holden – but he is truly one of, if not the best professor I've had at northwestern. He definitely took advice from previous c–techs and restructured his classes, specifically in regards to the weekly quizzes, which were more like attendance quizes if anything – very fair and easy if you did the readings. I know this is a required course but I genuinely learned so much with Holden, and as long as you put in the work, getting an A in this class is very doable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this course with this professor. It is the best class you will take at Medill, no contest."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Holden is great. He is tough but fair and is a really good professor. This class is what you make of it. If you show an interest in the material and read the cases, you will get a lot out of it and take away key ideas that are helpful for journalists."
jour,jour,370,spring,Joseph Mathewson,3.96,3.63,3.93,3.43,3.41,4.20,"This class was very manageable. You have to go to every class, but can do whatever you want while you're there. There's a weekly memo that takes a few hours, but if you read the textbook, it's not hard. Be sure to name–drop a bunch of court cases and laws in each memo. Sometimes the professor's grading is pretty inconsistent, so you might get kind of random grades, which is unfortunate. But overall I didn't struggle much."
,,,,,,,,,,,Weekly writing assignments based on the readings. Need to be very thorough to do well. Participation in class is graded. Final was 2 hours to do the equivalent of 3 of the weekly writing assignments plus an extra credit. Lectures were not very helpful but you need to go for participation points.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class with Professor Mathewson. Not too difficult, may be hard to pay attention at times, but the information is very applicable to journalism!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"A lot of people were very negative about the weekly assignments in the class, but I really don't think they're that hard. If you know the material well enough, you'll be fine. You need to keep in mind that even though a hypothetical case could go either way, you need to be very decisive in the decision you make in your writing. Professor Mathewson is very kind though, and it's nice that he makes an effort to meet and get to know every student. He let me miss class a couple of times when I had reporting assignments for a student publication. Sometimes you will inevitably disagree with the grading, but I think most Medill students are just taken off guard by it because we're used to being graded on longer–term writing assignments and not on how clearly and decisively we can make decisions. The cost of the book for the class versus how much you'll actually use the book is ridiculous, though."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is what it is; it's a requirement and it's not too much work. Weekly writing assignments, no midterm, open book final. In my experience, Professor Mathewson could be really arbitrary with his grading – I got pretty low grades on some of the written assignments just because what he wanted wasn't clear."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Just one of those required classes you have to take. Joe is a very nice man but can be very difficult to learn from. I had trouble following course concepts a lot and struggled with the weekly assignments for they were sometimes vague and he would pose questions afterward that you would never even think of. It's not actually a lot of work, but your grade is heavily dependent on just a few assignments and a big final exam."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty easy but pretty boring. Prof. Matthewson is very sweet and really invested in his students, but lectures can be kind of boring"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The content of this course is quite interesting. Students learn about the history of media law and ethics, which includes a substantial constitutional law education, that will serve any professional journalist well out in the real world."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is truly not that bad. To be fair, I came into this class as someone generally interested in law. Even if you aren't, you can definitely help yourself out a lot. 1) sit as close to Mathewson as possible. He speaks very quietly and it's so loud in the room. 2) actually pay attention. Everyone in my class was always so obviously doing other work on their computers, and Mathewson will like you more if you participate (and I feel like he grades you easier if he knows you're engaged in class). 3) for the written assignments you just have to be as detailed as you can. Cite a bunch of cases for precedent. Actually do the readings. You do actually have to put in work in this class. Is it the most fun? No. Some of the readings are dense, and the assignments take a while. The final exam is exhausting. Lectures can be boring. Is it that hard? Also no, as long as you're actually trying. Some of the speakers are cool. Commit to the bit and you'll be fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course felt like a study hall. The lectures droned on and were not presented in a stimulating way. There were weekly written responses due each Saturday, but I did all of the learning for these on my own time because the teaching made me want to fall asleep. One good thing was that many guest speakers came in which helped me differentiate the different topics we covered. But overall my least favorite class in Medill so far, which is unfortunate because the topics are definitely applicable and important to a journalism career."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a pretty easy A if you do the weekly assignments, though those can be tedious and classes are usually not super engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,NA
,,,,,,,,,,,"it was alright, professor mathewson is great, course is not very engaging though"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Matthewson is a really nice man who clearly knows a lot about the subject, but he is simply too old to be teaching. We could barely hear him in the letures and the class was usually super disorganized. The writing assignments aren't bad if you follow the formula he wants. It's a shame that it's like this because there is a lot of interesting content in this class. He did bring in a few very interesting guest speakers, though."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Mathewson is very nice, but not much learning was done. There was a lot of reading off the slides, and it was difficult to get effective feedback from him on our weekly questions, which were the primary source of the class's grades. Overall the class wasn't hard, and the guest lecturers were interesting, but I didn't learn much."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty standard course about media law. Lots of reading about SCOTUS cases and laws related to journalism/publication. The material is important if you're pursuing a career in journalism, and therefore this class is required for Medill students. Overall the class is not very interesting outside of the occasional guest speaker (all of whom were cool to learn from). Grading is nit–picky; points are docked often on weekly assignments for very specific things about a law/case that may not be mentioned in the assignment. Professor is often unclear about what is desired from assignments. Take–home final exam. Outside of the required textbook, materials are hard to find/not always on canvas."

,,,,,,,,,,,Dr. Greenwell is so caring. I really appreciated the instruction material she picked and the activities in class. I wished the lectures were more in–depth. Sometimes it felt like we were scratching the surface. Overall a good class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Wouldn't recommend this class if you're not doing your JR in South Africa. The contrast between students preparing to live abroad and those taking it as a distro was kind of obvious, and the workload is catered to those doing their JR (so there's a crazy amount of readings – although only some of them are quizzed, so possible to skip). Final project required five sources, but only allotted seven minutes for the final presentation, so wasn't possible to actually include everything and felt rushed."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely a prep for people going to South Africa but still really engaging if you’re not, especially if you're interested in international journalism. There’s one big final project/article, a fair amount of readings and weekly quizzes, but the workload is really manageable. Classes are pretty much all discussion of South Africa and the project, which is a really interesting topic. The course is organized well too, very straightforward. Dr. Greenwell knows so much about the country and is helpful in navigating how to approach the big topic. Only thing is that the reading quiz questions felt a little unnecessarily specific sometimes and I think it would have been better if they were more comprehensive, but that's a minor thing."
,,,,,,,,,,,A fine enough prep class!
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is mostly readings and watching a documentary. There are reading quizzes, but they're not too bad. I would recommend starting on the final project – which includes interviewing at least 3 sources from South Africa – early, but that is honestly the main challenge of the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Greenwell is a great professor, but this class is very poorly structured. The weekly assignments all require vastly different amounts of effort (reading an entire 300pg book vs watching a short documentary) even though they're weighted the same, and the final assignment requires extensive research and reporting that you do not get the chance to properly present to the profs or your peers due to poor class planning. The subject material is fascinating, but the class is so poorly structured that I wouldn't recommend taking it unless it changes vastly."
,,,,,,,,,,,"STUDENT WHO WENT ON JR: I thought this was an awesome class to learn the country's history ahead of going there. It was a tremendous help and I loved the format of the final project as a research assignment where I was able to apply my work all quarter. I was able to focus on a topic I was interested in and dive deep into things. Dr. Greenwell is amazing too and super engaging. All the content we consumed outside of class was more narrative–based media, which made it interesting and engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,"My main reaction to the course is that a deep, fundamental knowledge of the history of South Africa, gained through texts and documentaries, provided crucial context for how we could develop our own stories focusing on present issues. I think this is a lesson that can be applied to coverage of any area or culture that you as a journalist are unfamiliar with."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course was unlike any course I've taken at Northwestern simply due to the nature of the content and the fact that South African history and politics are not taught in many classrooms in the United States. Still, I think the course could've been more organized, and the Canvas page was confusing. Students felt like there were mixed signals, and the final project presentation was much too short for the amount of emphasis given on it throughout the quarter and the weight it had on our grades."

Being able to travel to another state and profile someone in their own home (with a professional videographer!) is an experience I'll never forget, and it made me a lot more comfortable in my interviewing skills. That being said, there are many areas MIL could improve in. At the start, Prof. Cenziper (who is fantastic) emphasized that we would be able to learn about the forms of journalism we were most interested in (ex. data reporting, videojournalism) and that we would be connected with experts who could lead us through that. However, the class turned out to be extremely print–focused, and there were few chances to actually be mentored. Communication could also be clearer (ex. Would we have class the next day? When were we travelling?). Finally, I DO NOT think this class should be a replacement for JR. While it was a wonderful experience, MIL is in no way a substitute for a real journalism internship where you go into the newsroom every day. I know many people who have done this program in the past and are disappointed because they can no longer do JR. Medill, please change this."

jour,jour,374,winter,Jodi Cohen,5.33,4.75,5.42,5.25,5.44,8.67,"I feel like it's been a while since I've grown this much from a single class in Medill. I really learned how to think critically when interviewing, researching, and checking my sources. We also got to read good examples of investigative reporting and talk to investigative reporters. Louise and Jodi are also incredible reporters themselves, so learning from their experiences and getting their feedback was great. I would recommend this to someone interested in getting their feet wet with investigative reporting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course helped me a lot with tools that journalists can access in their research stage, whether they are doing an investigative or normal story."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you are looking for a class to chill and not do work, this is not that class. That being said, this was the best reporting class I have taken during my four years in medill. Louise and Jodi were the perfect balance of perspectives, with their experiences in editing and reporting. I felt like every class/week I learned something valuable and ended up with a final project I felt genuinely proud of. I can't emphasize enough how amazing this class is if you are willing to put in the effort. Would not recommend taking it alongside another reporting class and would highly recommend taking advantage of having office hours with instructors with such a depth of experience. Can't recommend the course enough!!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's a lot of work but well worth it. Prof. Kiernan and Prof. Cohen are respectful of your time and always use class time in a meaningful way, to introduce you to the tools necessary for investigative journalism. I grew so much as a writer, rediscovered a love of journalism, and loved coming to class despite it being at 9:30 in the morning haha!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a wonderful introduction to investigative journalism!! The professors were both very engaging, very willing to help you on your project, and are very knowledgeable in their fields. The big project can sometimes be stressful for everyone in the class, but that's usually normal with every journalism class. I highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I definitely recommend this class. Was not confusing as there is an emphasis on process over product, meaning that we took the time in class to work through different aspects of an investigative piece so we understood what we had to do outside of the classroom. I haven't taken too many active reporting/writing classes in Medill and was not overwhelmed diving into this class. Professor Kiernan and Jodi were very approachable and happy to help in whatever way they could."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought that this class really pushed me, it was just really hard at times to get sources to talk to you."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was really excited for this class, and I was extremely let down. While we had some good class discussions and learned about interesting investigative cases, expectations for the main assignment were so unrealistic. I felt like every time I met with Jodi and Louise, they put me down and disregarded my reporting efforts. They made me feel like there was no chance I could meet their expectations and produce something good, even though I tried so hard and spent so much energy on this class. I wish they had been more helpful and mindful of how much other work we had going on. They assumed this story was our main priority, and it took up way more time than my other classes. I enjoyed learning about their experiences and having speakers in class, but when it came down to our own work, I had an awful experience. At least I know I won't go into investigative journalism, but this class kind of destroyed my quarter. My other friends were so shocked at the guidelines and requirements for our main story and couldn't believe how much time I'd spent on it only to be constantly put down when asking for feedback. I also felt awful having to take so much time from real sources just for a class project. I wouldn't recommend this class."
jour,jour,374,winter,Louise Kiernan,5.18,4.75,5.42,5.25,5.27,8.67,"I feel like it's been a while since I've grown this much from a single class in Medill. I really learned how to think critically when interviewing, researching, and checking my sources. We also got to read good examples of investigative reporting and talk to investigative reporters. Louise and Jodi are also incredible reporters themselves, so learning from their experiences and getting their feedback was great. I would recommend this to someone interested in getting their feet wet with investigative reporting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course helped me a lot with tools that journalists can access in their research stage, whether they are doing an investigative or normal story."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you are looking for a class to chill and not do work, this is not that class. That being said, this was the best reporting class I have taken during my four years in medill. Louise and Jodi were the perfect balance of perspectives, with their experiences in editing and reporting. I felt like every class/week I learned something valuable and ended up with a final project I felt genuinely proud of. I can't emphasize enough how amazing this class is if you are willing to put in the effort. Would not recommend taking it alongside another reporting class and would highly recommend taking advantage of having office hours with instructors with such a depth of experience. Can't recommend the course enough!!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's a lot of work but well worth it. Prof. Kiernan and Prof. Cohen are respectful of your time and always use class time in a meaningful way, to introduce you to the tools necessary for investigative journalism. I grew so much as a writer, rediscovered a love of journalism, and loved coming to class despite it being at 9:30 in the morning haha!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a wonderful introduction to investigative journalism!! The professors were both very engaging, very willing to help you on your project, and are very knowledgeable in their fields. The big project can sometimes be stressful for everyone in the class, but that's usually normal with every journalism class. I highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I definitely recommend this class. Was not confusing as there is an emphasis on process over product, meaning that we took the time in class to work through different aspects of an investigative piece so we understood what we had to do outside of the classroom. I haven't taken too many active reporting/writing classes in Medill and was not overwhelmed diving into this class. Professor Kiernan and Jodi were very approachable and happy to help in whatever way they could."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought that this class really pushed me, it was just really hard at times to get sources to talk to you."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was really excited for this class, and I was extremely let down. While we had some good class discussions and learned about interesting investigative cases, expectations for the main assignment were so unrealistic. I felt like every time I met with Jodi and Louise, they put me down and disregarded my reporting efforts. They made me feel like there was no chance I could meet their expectations and produce something good, even though I tried so hard and spent so much energy on this class. I wish they had been more helpful and mindful of how much other work we had going on. They assumed this story was our main priority, and it took up way more time than my other classes. I enjoyed learning about their experiences and having speakers in class, but when it came down to our own work, I had an awful experience. At least I know I won't go into investigative journalism, but this class kind of destroyed my quarter. My other friends were so shocked at the guidelines and requirements for our main story and couldn't believe how much time I'd spent on it only to be constantly put down when asking for feedback. I also felt awful having to take so much time from real sources just for a class project. I wouldn't recommend this class."
jour,jour,376,fall,Zach Wise,4.83,4.75,4.64,4.33,4.92,3.67,"I REALLY enjoyed this course. I've always referred to myself as ""design–challenged,"" and I had really low faith in my ability to do this class well. That's what made this class really great. Professor Wise is really encouraging and helpful, and he always makes sure we feel confident in our ability to do assignments. I learned so much about design principles and actually felt really good about the work I created. I have also already applied these principles to extracurriculars that I'm involved with. The only critique I have of the class is we still haven't gotten any grades back, so I have no idea how I'm doing, which made it more difficult to change course for final projects if need be. Otherwise, no complaints."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is really chill, and if you're interested in learning about the Adobe Creative Suite, how to create fun & compelling social media graphics/ways to tell stories, then you should take it. Prof. Wise is super chill, the class itself is very relaxed. You get a lot of in–class time to work on assignments. The final project is so open–ended, you can create literally anything you want, you just have to use the ideas you've learned in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a pretty good Medill class. Weekly assignments were pretty manageable and allowed a lot of room for creativity. I will warn that we weren't really taught the basics of Photoshop or other Adobe platforms so the class is a bit harder if you have no design experience.
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a great class. Prof. Wise is one of few in Medill who actually cares about the future or journalism and what that looks like. All of the classwork is worthwhile and has purpose behind it. Day–to–day class is very relaxed and easy to follow. No design experience necessary: It is more about the theory than the software knowledge or anything. Take it!
,,,,,,,,,,,Very fun and relaxing class with solid amounts of time between assignments and a very manageable workload. Most classes are peer feedback sessions or work/demo sessions. This is great because the lectures aren't very interesting. Zach is a great professor and I loved seeing some of the work he's designed in the past for New York Times. One wish I have for the class was for grades to be released periodically. It's reading week and I still have no idea what grade I got in any assignment I've submitted over the entire quarter.
,,,,,,,,,,,"you don’t really learn too much in this class besides principles of design. Zach is a good resource, and I did learn a lot about Adobe XD. But it’s nice to create some thing that you want and see the result."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class can be really fun if you put in the effort. We do a number of hands–on projects which you are able to get personalized feedback from. The environment of the class is very laid–back and supportive, which allow you to really take creative risks."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Awesome Medill elective! It was clear some people had extensive design experience whereas others had none, but anyone could learn something from the class. It does take a while to get anything graded, so I have no clue how I actually did in the course, though"
jour,jour,376,winter,Zach Wise,5.45,5.27,4.82,4.55,5.45,4.46,"Prof Wise is a super great resource for media design projects, and he was able to help with just about any question any of us had, or with any idea any of us wanted to accomplish. This class really only covered the basics of media design, but it was enough so that the class felt laidback and piqued my interest in pursuing more design experience in the future."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was probably my favorite class I’ve ever taken at NU. Professor Wise just wants you to learn and become better at design, he encourages students to go out of their comfort zone with design and it’s great the way we’re all able to give each other feedback. Super awesome class and definitely try to take if you can!!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great class in that it taught me how to design for social media and it was not too time–consuming. It also allowed me to use a different part of my brain than my other classes, which were all reading and writing heavy. I recommend this class to Medill students who don't want to report and would be interested in building a new skill."
,,,,,,,,,,,I learned how to be more critical about decisions I make when designing story–based Instagram posts/stories. The class format was great–– half the time we just had work time for for whatever assignments we had. Zach is super easy to ask questions to and gives extensive feedback.
,,,,,,,,,,,best class ever
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great course, and Prof. Wise did a great job of making the topics we covered in this class feel approachable/not overly intimidating. He was always very supportive and provided constructive feedback."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course is a good primer to design principles and for a beginner to get started with getting more creative experience. I took it with a minimal design background and thoroughly enjoyed it. The class focused primarily on designing for Instagram (or the vertical phone screen format), which makes sense since that's how many people mostly consume media now. I think the design principles overall can definitely be carried over to other mediums, but I was hoping we could get a glimpse into designing for different platforms. Perhaps one or two classes that touch on web or tablet design would be nice."
,,,,Zach Wise,,,,,,,This class was a great intro to design. Zach is a very nice professor and the class is pretty relaxed overall. Definitely a good class to take if you need a journalism class but don't want to do a ton of reporting.
jour,jour,376,spring,Zach Wise,5.00,5.00,4.60,4.60,5.20,3.80,"nice chill class, Zach Wise is great"
,,,,Zach Wise,,,,,,,"This class was... different than I expected. We had a series of small assignments that we'd critique in class. Strangely, we don't use photoshop or illustrator we use Adobe XD which doesn't make much sense to me. We had a lot of freedom to explore style, subject–matter, and topics and went into typography, photography, Instagram stories, etc. I did feel like we almost had too much freedom where I didn't know exactly what we were supposed to be doing in class or for a certain assignment. Prof Wise is very nice but also I don't think he knew anyone's names by the end of the quarter and never responded to my emails. But, this is a very chill class if you're looking to explore graphic design (but be aware that the design skill themselves you'll have to learn on your own, we only were taught theory in lecture) it's a good way to explore it!"
,,,,Zach Wise,,,,,,,"Wise is a great professor and this course is a super chill Medill elective. I don't feel like I learned all that much, but it was fun to play with design tools and I liked being able to be creative. Not really a reporting class, the only part of the class that requires a little bit of reporting is the final project (and that could even be done without reporting)."
,,,,Zach Wise,,,,,,,"Professor Wise clearly knows a lot about media design, so getting to hear his thoughts/critiques on work really helped and I learned a lot from it."
jour,jour,377,fall,Fernando Diaz,5.70,5.50,5.50,5.40,5.70,5.80,This course opened career opportunities and a new way to look for story ideas. I learned a lot of skills I didn't know before and can still use outside of this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a really great course. Prof. Diaz is both understanding and fair and is really intent on his students taking practical information away from his class. Not a ton of work but make sure to put plenty of effort into the assignments you do get because it will mean a lot.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class – it was easily one of my favorite all–time classes at Medill or NU as a whole. For anyone who's doing the Journalism major along with a Data Science major/minor, I strongly recommend this class. The required work outside of class is extremely manageable and we do most of the learning for content and lessons during class time. I also enjoyed the format of the final project/presentation for this quarter. No coding experience is necessary whatsoever, but any background is kind of like ""brownie points"" in terms of the ways and methods you create visualizations and graphics for homework. Fernando Diaz is also just a wonderful professor who is one of the most supportive and approachable faculty here at this university. The only downside is that the class was from 9:30 am to 12:20 pm this quarter, so it was a bit of a marathon to sit still and stay engaged the whole time (even with breaks)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was an amazing exploration into the world of data journalism and no–code data analysis. Professor Diaz is great, and we were able to work with data relevant to current events and/or our interests. We learn skills that are very applicable for future careers, whether you want to become a journalist or not. Definitely recommend taking this class"
,,,,,,,,,,,"One of the best Medill classes I have taken. Professor Diaz is fantastic. I really liked how he let us have a say in the class design (we got to pick when hw was due, choose what the final exam was, etc). Professor Diaz very clearly showed that he cared about his students, and he was more than happy to help us individually on any of our assignments. Overall, the workload for the class was perfect for me, with one data journal entry a week. Though the 3–hour course was long, Professor Diaz does a great job splitting the class into sections and making it engaging. The data workshops were super helpful and fun. The midterm and final projects were interesting and not too time–consuming."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Despite the expected emphasis on technical skills and factual accuracy in data journalism, this course was even stronger in developing soft skills, judgment, and creativity. As an aspiring data journalist coming in with my own set of technical skills and life experiences, this course went far beyond my expectations in helping me establish a vision and a road map for how I might continue developing my ability to bring publicly available data to light in digestible forms. It'll be interesting to look back on this course in a few years to reflect on where this path is leading me."
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof. Diaz is awesome. This class came closest to what its like to work in a real newsroom.
jour,jour,377,winter,Simon Rogers,5.09,4.82,4.45,3.73,4.91,3.33,This class was super cool! We even got to go to the San Francisco Google Office!
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class. Simon does a fantastic job showing us resources to use and bringing in speakers from the industry. A chill fun into to data journalism
jour,jour,377,winter,Fernando Diaz,5.40,5.47,5.47,5.20,5.40,5.39,I enjoyed this class. The content is interesting and helpful for future abilities. Definitely a spin away from journalism which I appreciated.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very introductory course to data visualizations. Didn't take a ton of time each week besides the 3 hour class, but that class didn't feel long AT ALL. love fernando diaz, and you get a cool intro to the world of data vises."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great course. Learned a lot of really valuable skills and in an engaging way. Sometimes it could be a little disorganized, but for the most part, enjoyed it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"helpful to learn a little bit more about data and viz that i didn't know yet as a senior. some of the material was dry to me personally just because i didn't want to follow elections in particular, but there is an option in the middle to work on a project that is tailored more to your liking. interesting and only once a week, and the professor was very nice and willing to work with us on what we needed!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was AMAZING!! I had virtually no interest in data–science before this course as though I am a journalism major, I di not like the idea of just crunching numbers and such. But through this course, I was able to learn in ways that interested and engaged me. 100% one of the bestt courses I have taken at Northwestern and the best course I have taken in Medill!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"A great class! I learned data journalism is honestly quite tedious and there's a lot of boring and/or difficulty work, but you get all of the basic skills in the end. A pretty fun and chill class environment as well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned about useful tools like Datawrapper and Flourish. I also learned more about tools within Google Sheets, all while using really large volumes of data."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Diaz was awesome, he really helped us narrow down data and make it digestible. You learn many useful skills in the course that you will actually use in real time regardless of career you enter into. The engagement with data is really awesome and Diaz helps you fully understand why its important to have strong data skills."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Diaz is great! His experience and connections in journalism, specifically data journalism, proved time and time again to be invaluable in the learning experience of the class. He was able to provide on–the–ground data and info for us to work with, as well as inviting other professional perspectives into the class. He is also super helpful in working through issues with students. Although this is his last quarter at Medill, I do hope that this course can be picked up by someone else to continue his legacy!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class and amazing professor! If you get the chance, please take this course. I built skills not only for journalism but any career."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great way to learn how to analyze data. Sometimes felt like busy work, but that's just what data journalism entails. Had projects to work in during class that had to be finished as homework. Barely any outside–of–class work. Had data journals where we just found data journalism in the news and wrote about it once a week. One presentation about a data journalism project you would work on. Overall grade based on effort it seems like."
jour,jour,378,fall,Brent Huffman,5.29,4.71,5.00,4.14,4.86,6.43,"Prof. Huffman is very laid–back and very knowledgable about photography. He's willing to help out for anyone who asks. I never worried about getting a bad grade on assignments as long as I was putting in effort, which was a huge relief in an intro to photojournalism class. You honestly don't even have to buy the book the professor mentions, we talked about a chapter once, beyond that you can learn everything you need to know in lectures. Pro tip: don't forget your SD card in a computer in main library if that's how you choose to upload your photos :')"
,,,,,,,,,,,Loved this class. It truly made me reconsider my career. Professor Huffman is super understanding in terms of deadlines on assignments and provides assistance with publishing. Take this class if you have any interest in photography or journalism!
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed taking this course with Professor Huffman. It definitely pushed me to step outside of my comfort zone, and I learned a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was great. Even though it only met once a week, we were able to learn through doing. The variety of assignments built fundamental skills necessary to be a working photojournalist, and Prof. Huffman empowered us to use the assignments we created in class to further our career outside the classroom –– publications, awards, etc."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great course and certainly beginner friendly. Professor Huffman pushes students to go beyond their comfort zones, get work published and submit work for awards. There are also great guest speakers and wonderful class connection opportunities in the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"MEDILL, PLEASE LISTEN. I'm primarily interested in photojournalism, and this class was a reminder of how little Medill cares about multimedia. Huffman is a good professor and it's not his fault for this, but it's ridiculous that this school hasn't hired at least one photojournalist to teach, especially since everyone tells me I'm supposed to get to know professors, so it just feels like the whole field is an afterthought. We had a guest speaker who's primarily a photojournalist, and he had some great insights that I would've loved to hear more of rather than watching videos of a bunch of old white savior photojournalists talking. The whole time I was wondering why he wasn't teaching this class. The assignments are very flexible, and I'm glad that they forced me to create photo stories that I'm proud of, but everything I did could've just been done for a publication and not the class since I already had photo experience. I wanted to give the intro class a try just because it's the only photojournalism class offered so I might as well, but it didn't feel like I was gaining much outside of the entirely independent assignments. PLEASE HIRE ONE PHOTOJOURNALIST. How is this supposed to be the best journalism school in the country?"
jour,jour,383,winter,Patti Wolter,5.93,5.86,5.93,5.86,5.86,6.99,"I thought this course was a great overview of health and science reporting. It's exposed me to numerous concepts I had had very little experience with, but have formed an integral part in my science communication education. I particularly enjoyed producing a diverse range of content, from news briefs to full features. It allowed me to put lessons to practice in a really effective way."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was an excellent course about science journalism. It is significantly more work than 517, which surprised me a little, but it was worthwhile. I got to try my hand at interviewing and reporting, which was new to me."
,,,,,,,,,,,Best journalism class I've ever taken. Prof. Wolter is amazing.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class. Professor Wolter is very approachable and the assignments are genuinely challenging, in a good way. I feel like I actually learned how to be a better science writer."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a must take!!! Patti Wolter is a fantastic instructor and she truly cares deeply about each and every one of her students. If you put in the work during this class, you will get so much out of it. All the readings are super interesting and not very time consuming. If you are interested in health and science, this course will be a joy for you to take."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely a useful course that really gives scientists and engineers the unique opportunity to be a journalist for a quarter. I had to get out of my comfort zone a bit to have success in this class but I was thankful for it in the end. I ended up really enjoying the expert sources I interviewed and had really quality conversations with them about relevant scientific issues. I would not have had this opportunity in any other course I could have taken in TGS or McCormick. This class is certainly one of a kind for STEM students.Know this: it was quite a bit of work. There were several larger writing assignments that amounted to probably 15–18 pages of original writing/reporting, and there was a significant amount of legwork that went into accomplishing that such as research on topics, interviewing upwards of 10 experts, etc. It was not easy to balance with full–time research, other responsibilities, etc. That said, I am thankful that I took it, and it was sufficiently rigorous to show me the life and work of a science journalist, which was really valuable. Despite the workload, I enjoyed the larger summative assignments that I previously mentioned (media critique, news briefs, background literature searching, final narrative assignment). There was flexibility in the final assignment for us STEM PhDs which I appreciated, I was able to tailor the assignment and the writing solely to my interests rather than picking a subject that would make for a good written piece without my inherent interest. I'll admit I did not like the smaller formative assignments or the periodic discussion boards that much. Some of the smaller formative assignments were in–class exercises/writings, and they are designed to simulate the time crunch that journalists often feel which is fair, but usually it resulted in some less than stellar output from me without much gained in terms of learning. I'm not sure I like trying to get better at writing under a time crunch by just trial and error, but I guess I can't think of a better way to do it. For that reason, I'd give the in–class assignments a pass, but it doesn't mean they weren't frustrating occasionally. The discussion boards (STEM PhDs had to respond to all of them...) felt like busy work. We had to read super long science writing pieces and reflect on them, and frankly they just didn't help my learning in this course and felt like a chore. The readings were mostly interesting, but there were definitely some slogs that I had to reflect on that I didn't enjoy much. Additionally, I had no interest or incentive to read my peers' reflections, so I often just wrote my reflection because I had to and then left the discussion thread. I would've rather devoted some class time to discussing more of the readings than we did instead of just writing in a discussion board and never thinking about the readings again. I'm also not the biggest fan of the grading system (check, check plus, check minus). It felt too arbitrary, and it made me feel like I had to ""wow"" Prof. Wolter with the content in my writing more than I had to focus on learning the fundamentals of journalism. There were assignments that I poured hours and hours into that I was really proud of that just got checks, and then there were a few assignments that I more or less threw together with a bow on top that got check pluses. The feedback was typically substantive which was great, but since there is even less nuance in ""check"" vs. ""check plus"" than there is in a normal grading system of A through F grades, a lot of feedback is required to make up for that. There often wasn't. As a result, it felt like my hard work was reduced to just a passing symbol that feedback didn't make up for each time."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was great! Lots of work outside of class, but professor wolter is THE BEST and genuinely wants you to do well! Can't recommend this course enough!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Medill so far. I learned so much about a whole new area of journalism I hadn't been exposed to previously (I'm not a very STEM oriented person for obvious reasons), and now I feel like science writing is something I'd actually consider pursuing in the future. Patti gives you a ton of creative freedom in terms of what your final feature is, and I got to write something I'm super proud of AND I was passionate about. The grading system is quite different from what you might expect from a Medill class. Patti's really committed to giving you a safe space to actually feel comfortable with experimenting and getting ambitious about what you want to do, without fearing getting punished with a letter grade. I came into this not knowing much about science journalism but now I'm going to be seeking it out more and more. Patti's classes are amazing and I wish all my Medill classes had been structured like this – it's a lot of work, of course, so report ahead, but this is the kind of class/projects that restored my love for writing. If you have ANY interest in science journalism at all, TAKE THIS CLASS!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This course had such a good balance of structure and freedom. Students were encouraged to pursue their interests within the realm of health and science reporting while maintaining two–sided communication with the professor about their progress and building skills to make the end product of a feature story pan out successfully.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I love this class! I encourage anyone to take a class with Patti, she's a fantastic professor who really cares about everyone's learning and progress. She was always helpful talking through assignments and the class was very well structured."
jour,jour,384,winter,Pradnya Joshi,4.90,5.70,5.70,5.80,4.86,5.00,Matt Orr stan for real! A great class
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think national political reporting was just not my favorite thing in the end, but that's not a fault of the course. Overall, I appreciated the flexibility to cover what we wanted to and was able to throw in other topics of interest besides politics."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course. !0/10 experience. If you're thinking about doing it, do it! I learned so much and would do it all over again if I could."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I can definitely say that I have never learned as much about journalism in any other Medill class besides this one, and that's purely because this is basically working a 9–to–5 job as a real reporter in a real newsroom. All of the few complaints I have are in regards to the lack of structure and introductory guidance in this course. It is terrifying to be dropped in the middle of an unfamiliar city, working alongside professional reporters, walking inside important buildings and chasing after important people. The first few weeks of this course could be better adjusted to acknowledge how difficult that transition is, and, again, more structure would make a huge difference. Some self–directedness is necessary and helpful, but the course is almost entirely self–directed. Aside from that, it was an invaluable experience in terms of learning what it's like to really work as a reporter, to face good and bad interviews, to chase down sources, and to file on deadline."
,,,,,,,,,,,"MOTH truly is an unbelievable experience. You get full access to the Capitol and partial access to other government buildings and can pursue all the stories seasoned political reporters are chasing every day. The schedule is super laid back (4–day weekends!) so you also have time to explore DC, and the faculty treat you like adults: you're responsible for managing your own time and choosing when and on what you report. Matt truly is the sweetest and most supportive professor –– couldn't ask for anyone better to lead the program!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned so much about what it's like to be a real working journalist in D.C. over these 10 weeks. MOTH provides you with amazing opportunities, from getting to cover the State of the Union to interviewing lawmakers around the Capitol. Matt is an incredible leader and PJ really cares about her students. Programs like MOTH are the reason I applied to NU, and I am so thankful for all this experience has given me."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If there's one thing I'm happy I did since I got to Northwestern, it's go to Medill on the Hill. There are unparalleled opportunities for an undergraduate student here, no exaggeration. Upon arriving in D.C. our program leader Matt (who is amazing) got us full press credentials to the Capitol. This means that, without limitation, MOTH students are able to cover hearings, stakeouts, press conferences and votes in the same manner as full–time reporters from places like The New York Times, AP, NBC and more. It's hard to describe just how incredible this experience has been. I've covered high–stakes hearings, interviewed high–profile senators and representatives, and just overall been in situations I could've never imagined being in at this point in my journalism career. Needless to say, when you're in situations like this, your reporting exponentially improves. I learned more in 9 weeks than I did in my first three journalism classes combined. Also, Matt is such a great professor. He's understanding, but also helpful. Getting the chance to work with him has made the quarter way better than it would have been otherwise. The course is structured in a way which allows for a lot of work time during the week, but almost no additional work over the weekend or in the nights. This, to me, is my preferred way to learn because I'm able to have a life outside of my work while also feeling fulfilled in it. I've gotten to explore D.C. more this quarter than I have Chicago because of my abundance of time to myself. I could not have asked for a better quarter, and I highly recommend everyone do MOTH."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is really enjoyable, and Matt and PJ do a good job at encouraging you to report on your interests. You're required to do 5 real–time reporting stories, 1 enterprise, and 1 multimedia story, but you can definitely do more if you want."
,,,,,,,,,,,It was great to get practical experience in the field and super cool to have freedom to roam and learn in the capitol. Loved the experience.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm guessing that if you're reading these CTECs, you applied to MOTH on a whim, got in, and now it's December and you're trying to figure out what to expect. This course is completely choose your own adventure. Aside from some requirements you have to get done by the end of the quarter, it's up to you what you report on and when you do it. I definitely learned a lot by pursuing enterprise stories throughout the quarter, but the day–to–day reporting on the Hill got monotonous. It's hard to build sources there as a young journalist. Nonetheless, the level of access you get is incredible. Use your congressional press pass to get access to other places in D.C., like the White House, Supreme Court, and Pentagon."

The first few weeks of this course could be better adjusted to acknowledge how difficult that transition is, and, again, more structure would make a huge difference. Some self–directedness is necessary and helpful, but the course is almost entirely self–directed. Aside from that, it was an invaluable experience in terms of learning what it's like to really work as a reporter, to face good and bad interviews, to chase down sources, and to file on deadline."
,,,,,,,,,,,"MOTH truly is an unbelievable experience. You get full access to the Capitol and partial access to other government buildings and can pursue all the stories seasoned political reporters are chasing every day. The schedule is super laid back (4–day weekends!) so you also have time to explore DC, and the faculty treat you like adults: you're responsible for managing your own time and choosing when and on what you report. Matt truly is the sweetest and most supportive professor –– couldn't ask for anyone better to lead the program!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned so much about what it's like to be a real working journalist in D.C. over these 10 weeks. MOTH provides you with amazing opportunities, from getting to cover the State of the Union to interviewing lawmakers around the Capitol. Matt is an incredible leader and PJ really cares about her students. Programs like MOTH are the reason I applied to NU, and I am so thankful for all this experience has given me."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If there's one thing I'm happy I did since I got to Northwestern, it's go to Medill on the Hill. There are unparalleled opportunities for an undergraduate student here, no exaggeration. Upon arriving in D.C. our program leader Matt (who is amazing) got us full press credentials to the Capitol. This means that, without limitation, MOTH students are able to cover hearings, stakeouts, press conferences and votes in the same manner as full–time reporters from places like The New York Times, AP, NBC and more. It's hard to describe just how incredible this experience has been. I've covered high–stakes hearings, interviewed high–profile senators and representatives, and just overall been in situations I could've never imagined being in at this point in my journalism career. Needless to say, when you're in situations like this, your reporting exponentially improves. I learned more in 9 weeks than I did in my first three journalism classes combined. Also, Matt is such a great professor. He's understanding, but also helpful. Getting the chance to work with him has made the quarter way better than it would have been otherwise. The course is structured in a way which allows for a lot of work time during the week, but almost no additional work over the weekend or in the nights. This, to me, is my preferred way to learn because I'm able to have a life outside of my work while also feeling fulfilled in it. I've gotten to explore D.C. more this quarter than I have Chicago because of my abundance of time to myself. I could not have asked for a better quarter, and I highly recommend everyone do MOTH."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is really enjoyable, and Matt and PJ do a good job at encouraging you to report on your interests. You're required to do 5 real–time reporting stories, 1 enterprise, and 1 multimedia story, but you can definitely do more if you want."
,,,,,,,,,,,It was great to get practical experience in the field and super cool to have freedom to roam and learn in the capitol. Loved the experience.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm guessing that if you're reading these CTECs, you applied to MOTH on a whim, got in, and now it's December and you're trying to figure out what to expect. This course is completely choose your own adventure. Aside from some requirements you have to get done by the end of the quarter, it's up to you what you report on and when you do it. I definitely learned a lot by pursuing enterprise stories throughout the quarter, but the day–to–day reporting on the Hill got monotonous. It's hard to build sources there as a young journalist. Nonetheless, the level of access you get is incredible. Use your congressional press pass to get access to other places in D.C., like the White House, Supreme Court, and Pentagon."

I thought we were going to build what we wanted as long as it applied to media. Lectures were long and boring–– often generalized to entrepreneurship rather than entrepreneurship and media. While the guest speakers were good, I feel like I learned nothing about how to innovate in journalism. I really expected more out of Hayes and Prof. Gilbert, who have so much experience but didn't share much of it. Overall, don't take this if you actually want to learn about media innovation–– stick to Knight Lab"

Lectures were very interactive. I wish we had more room to choose what type of media innovation we wanted to make, or what purpose the media innovation is intended to serve. The speakers were very interesting. Though, some didn't have a direct tie–in to media. Some really were purely entrepreneurial in other industries. Overall, though, I am very glad I enrolled in the course."

,,,,,,,,,,,"this is an awful class. If you want an easy A, go for it. But otherwise, it is painful.

They impose a project on you that no one is actually interested in, so the entire quarter you have to PRETEND you are working on something you care about, but literally everyone knows it is fake. Such a joke."
,,,,,,,,,,,"All I took away from this course was that entrepreneurship is not for me. Even beyond the course content, I truly disliked how disorganized the class was; considering we had three professors AND a TA, you'd expect students to receive on–time feedback that was actually valuable, but we received no timely feedback or constructive criticism. Easiest A class you'll take just because the professors obviously do not care about students or the course either."

jour,jour,390,fall,Ava Greenwell,5.50,5.17,5.83,,,10.34,"Only take this course if you have a pretty solid background in broadcast journalism. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the class and learned a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course is a great opportunity and you learn so much. I did not have much experience in video or broadcast journalism before, so it was very difficult to get the hang of everything. If you do have that experience or are interested in broadcast, take this class. It is a little overwhelming and very time consuming, but Prof Greenwell helps a lot and it is a great experience. Also you have the chance to publish your project, which is amazing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was the most exciting so far of my Medill career, possibly the most exciting course I've taken at Northwestern overall. It was a ton of work, it consumed my life for at least 3 weeks in the second half of the quarter, but it was extremely rewarding and made me interested in a career in broadcast."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I absolutely loved this class! It was definitely time consuming, but very rewarding. We worked in teams on a story we pitched to WTTW. I learned so much about inequality in Chicago and was given the opportunity to hear the personal stories of minority groups in our region. It was so impactful having a story we created from start to finish get published at a Chicago station. Dr. Greenwell is amazing in giving feedback and helping throughout the whole process. Class time was operated as a newsroom, giving us the time to work on our stories and go out in the field. It was challenging at times having to schedule all the interviews and finish everything on time, so it’s definitely not a class to fall behind in. But it’s a great class for anyone interested in broadcast or video journalism and it gives you skills needed for the pitching, reporting and editing process."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The most challenging aspect of the class was booking interviews and getting responses from people. It was really hard to come up with backup plans for who to get and how to get certain people to talk. Because it took us so long to get interviews, it put us behind in the process, which was an additional stressor. Dealing with the CPS administration was the most challenging because of their lack of responses and the challenges of getting an interview."
,,,,,,,,,,,I also think that the group dynamic was also an additional challenge because there were a lot of moments when the distribution of labor was unequal. I also thought that the readings were mostly a review of what I already knew about journalism and media representation of marginalized communities. It didn’t contribute very much to my story ideas and I think it did take a fair amount of time away from the actual production process for our news stories.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, I really loved this class and I hope there are more opportunities like in Medill in the future."
jour,jour,390,fall,Steven Thrasher,4.40,4.10,4.55,4.50,4.30,5.00,"Great course, the class is very relevant and Dr. Thrasher is a real expert on viruses. I learned a lot and the structure works well/results in interesting discussions."
,,,,,,,,,,,NA
,,,,,,,,,,,I thought it was cool to have material come from the headlines.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The basis of this class was incredibly interesting, thinking about why disease manifests in certain populations / communities through certain social ""vectors."" I generally found the in–class discussions really interesting and Thrasher cares a lot about giving students a chance to speak and lead discussions. My only critique is that the structure of the class could be a little confusing without a TA – the deadlines for certain assignments could be hard to keep track of since they cycled through different groups."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Didn't enjoy this class, a lot of work and not a lot of accommodation."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was my favorite journalism class I have taken thus far! Not only was the material and discussion interesting, but I would say the organization of the class made sense and actually facilitated my learning. It was a decently large amount of reading and weekly reflections, but if you are interested in the topic it isn't too bad. Dr. Thrasher is very nice and knows a lot about the subject. I liked how contemporary and applicable the class felt. I also really liked the research groups format (you get split into research groups for each virus)."
,,,,,,,,,,,Dr. Thrasher is a great professor.
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof Thrasher is awesome and it was super cool to learn from him and read his book. The work was manageable –– but I did feel like the class lacked organization sometimes.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would avoid taking a class with Thrasher if you can. The first red flag for this course was that he made us buy his own book –– that's essentially about economic inequality. His grading is erratic, he never returns assignments in a timely manner, he was disorganized with the syllabus and assigning group project deadlines, and he often gave us little warning for looming deadlines. Our discussions in class were super interesting, but I'm not sure it was worth the stress that the class produced for me. He's definitely super knowledgeable about viruses and the content of the class, but to take an example, he would consistently misspell people's names or refuse to engage with certain points people brought up in class discussions. If you really need to take an elective and he teaches this class again, I would say the course material/the readings/the discussions are worth it, but there's a good chance you'll leave with a negative experience and a bad grade you didn't necessarily deserve."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Past CTECs of the course do not accurately capture what it was like... this class was honestly a mess, the grading made no sense, we had one assignment due on the first day of class with unclear instructions of what Dr. Thrasher expected, which was graded harshly and makes up 1 of 2 graded reading responses for the whole quarter. Why not give us comments on our first one and grade two randomly throughout the quarter? It literally makes no sense? In addition, we got all of our grades for the rest of our assignments during reading week which is also a disservice to us students as we have NO IDEA what our grade was except for the very first assignment we turned in on Day 1 of class. Although in–class discussions were really very dull, I don't think Dr Thrasher encouraged much discussion as a whole class everything felt so flat and uninteresting which is truly a shame since his book, The Viral Underclass, was really enlightening and interesting! The readings were definitely the best part of the class and I felt I learned a lot from those and the research I did on HIV/AIDS throughout the quarter. I wouldn't recommend this class to take but if you are interested in the subject matter I would just read Dr. Thrasher's book since it covers it all tbh."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I had high expectations coming into this class because I heard great things about Dr. Thrasher, but I ultimately came out of the course disappointed. The primary issue I had was that he was not present for half the time because he was on his book tour. Without a TA, we had to meet as a class without an instructor and heavily relied on one another to learn. When Dr. Thrasher was present, he used the time to either talk about his book tour traveling experience or his experience writing his book. More specifically, we barely talked about the contents of his book itself. When students offered insight or participated in the class, he would not give them equal praise and attention (which everyone deserved), spotlighting certain students and thanking them for their work over others. When we had a guest speaker who offered constructive feedback on projects, only then did he start criticizing student work in front of them. Arguably, there was minimal personal reflection on his part to see how he was not meeting the needs of the class versus his professional career outside of academia. I was hesitant to take a class where the professor taught with their own book, but I was optimistic because we are at NU. I should have stuck with my gut."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot in this class, but it is very discussion based (could be a positive or negative). Prof. Thrasher knows a lot about the subject but it can be hard to follow sometimes. Also the canvas page was very confusing."

My writing is definitely tighter and cleaner now than it was at the start of the class. Being in this class with only four other students really ensured every single one of us got a lot of producing and anchoring practice throughout the quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you've done any work with NNN, or want to take 312 to the next level –– this is the class for you. There's no doubt that 3 hours, twice a week is a lot of time, but it's because every class you are producing content. Whether it's a quick ""cut–in"" (2–5 min newscast) or a full 30 min newscast as a group, you really get the reps in to sharpen your writing and producing skills. Even on–air anchoring skills got better. I fully believe I am a better writer for broadcast because of the personalized feedback you receive after each newscast. Whether you have a ton of experience or just a bit, the class is made to your level.My only critique is that I loved our guest speakers (two different news directors) and would have liked to hear more from a variety of guests from across the industry."

,,,,,,,,,,,Prof. Nettles is one of the best Medill professors. She's so understanding and committed to working with her students to produce the best work possible.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class for those looking to get into audio. You will go over a lot of technique and do a lot of basic assignments. Arionne is awesome and so fun; she's a really cool professor and she totally gets the student perspective. I've taken audio classes before and done radio so the audio stuff was a lot of repeat for me. One thing is you have a lot of reporting days so you'll go weeks without meeting in person –– this is probably helpful for some, but for me it just meant I procrastinated a lot. So if you take this class just make sure to individually regulate yourself."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class with an awesome, accommodating Professor that will meet you where you are and help you get better at audio! A pretty chill class with 3–4 assignments, adn the ability to redo work. Great feedback from the Prof, and very ""meets you where you are"""
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Nettles is THE BEST. She's so kind and understanding, and a great instructor. She makes class fun to go to (when she has class), and she recognizes that students are crazy busy and would rather her students take time to rest and sleep than turn something in on time, which is so wonderful. I do wish we had just one or two more actual classes instead of office hours/reporting days where we learned more about Adobe Audition and such, but overall I loved the way the class was structured and it makes so much sense to have reporting days/office hours in a journalism in practice class like this one. I wish more Medill classes were structured like this. Medill: GIVE PROFESSOR NETTLES (AND AUDIO IN GENERAL) MORE RESOURCES!!! I know SO many audio students who WANT to take more audio classes at Medill and there just aren't enough of them. There's literally not an audio JR, which is INSANE especially considering how many jobs there are in podcasting nowadays."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great professor, great class! Don't underestimate how much time it takes to make a podcast that's only one or a few minutes – especially a very good one – if you haven't done this before. The workload was manageable, and Professor Nettles was very supportive and made a fun classroom experience."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is an extremely easy course especially if you need a journalism elective. There were literally only 3 assignments for the entire quarter so if you want a course with lots of practice audio assignments then this might not be the right fit. If you just want a chill course with minimal work and the nicest professor in the world, then take this course. Prof Nettles is so accommodating and truly cares about each of her students, so even though there aren't many assignments, she's understandings of how busy our lives are. So depending what you are looking for as mentioned above then do/don't take this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved the professor's love and genuine admiration for this topic. I think Professor Nettles' ability to relate the class to real–world jobs and her life was the most important to me.
,,,,,,,,,,,Course is very simple and straightforward.

The assignments were pretty evenly spaced out and you can afford to skip/skim the readings. Lectures were helpful too. The biggest thing is that for the final proposal, make sure you start that earlier than you plan to!! The deadline creeps up on you!! But other than that, I'm super glad I took this course. I had pretty limited research experience before the class and still found the content to be pretty engaging"
,,,,,,,,,,,Textbook chapters and lectures were consistent with each other and very clear. It was clear what we needed to know for the exam and what we would be expected to have put into each assignment. No assignment was particularly difficult but each challenged me in a different way and had me actively engage with the content I was learning.

Nettles is great, she's very understanding with extensions, she gives lots of time to work on stories in class, and when we do have lectures they're helpful and informative about audio stories and newsrooms."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very chill workload, you do a quick practice audio story, and the rest of the class is just working on three audio features (4–6 min each)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"LOVE PROF NETTLES !!! she is so kind and flexible and really cares about students. that being said, it's difficult for medill to have more advanced multimedia courses because there's limited profs to teach them, so i don't think i was pushed as much as i was expecting to be. but a really easy class, made some cool audio stories and didnt' waste half of the quarter getting to learn how to use audition like other classes would"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I appreciated how flexible the course was. While I learned a lot and ended the class with three audio features I would be proud to share with a future employer, it wasn't too overwhelming. Professor Nettles was always willing to help students out or give them grace if needed."
jour,jour,390,spring,Melissa Isaacson,4.90,5.40,5.30,4.10,5.40,3.73,"Missy is the best. She brought in great class speakers including well known journalists, Chris Collins, and even former NFL referee Jerry Markbreit. I wish she gave more personal anecdotes because she could have been one of those guest speakers in her own right, but as an aspiring sports journalist I found this class, and most of all forming a relationship with her, very valuable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great class that anyone interested in sports media should take !! Professor Isaacson is so helpful and really cares for everyone to learn. She brings in amazing speakers, and the assignments are engaging and help you learn a lot about covering sports. Take this class !!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, I thought this was a really good course. Missy is always at an inherent disadvantage teaching this class, because about half the class will be veteran sports reporters and the other half or quarter complete newbies. So, that means she'll either have to teach more of the nuts and bolts or mostly bring in guest speakers for the students to then used their pre–established skills. This year, it was almost all guest speakers and she didn't teach any of the lede/nutgrah stuff or how to ask questions. But, I still think it was a great class. However, it's called intro sports journalism, which really is not that accurate. I would say it is more of an intermediate sports journalism class. I came into it with basically no sports reporting experience and did just fine, but keep that in mind. Also, this is not the type of course to like ""dip your toe in the water"" if you no nothing about sports. Given how knowledge the other students in the class are on sports, and the general precision required in the sports industry, you will be way in over your head. I'd consider myself a decently avid sports fan, and still felt behind compared to my classmates."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you're at all interested in learning more about sports writing, there are few better to take a class with than Professor Isaacson. While the class didn't feature much of her actually lecturing or teaching, the guest speakers she assembled were outstanding and provided real–world, practical advice. Professor Isaacson's grading on assignments was a little tough, but the stories offer you a chance to go out and cover games/complete interviews with some pretty prominent sources."
,,,,,,,,,,,Really enjoyed all facets of it
,,,,,,,,,,,Missy is great
jour,jour,390,spring,Michael Spike,5.54,5.31,4.38,4.15,5.31,3.31,"One of my favorite journalism classes at Medill. Prof. Spikes is amazing! If you are already familiar with Adobe, the first couple classes may feel a little slow, but I really enjoyed the opportunity to create my own podcast!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class got better and more useful as it went along. Some of the assignments at the beginning seemed very much like busy work, but the production of the final podcast provided good interviewing and audio editing experience."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good class. The first half of the class is spent learning about podcasting techniques and practicing audio editing, and the second half is spent making a group podcast episode. Not much of a time commitment, I would have almost liked the class to be faster paced. We got lots of creative freedom which I liked."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class gave me a crash course on how to use Audition, but if you already know Premiere, you can figure it out yourself. The class was just okay. Professor Spikes is very passionate and a super nice guy, but I would have liked to produce a podcast before the final project."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was a good introduction to podcasting. We covered a lot of the basics of recording, editing and creating podcasts. Spikes is a great professor too. Overall, would recommend!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a great course! I learned a lot about both the terminology used in the podcasting world and how to actually create a podcast and edit it. Professor Spikes is engaging and very willing to work with you outside of class to help you create the best product you can. He clearly cares about all his students and making sure we learn!
,,,,,,,,,,,Class is easy and fun elective to take. Prof is super nice and helpful. Class started off a little slow but making a podcast hands–on taught me a lot. Take the class w a friend because it is a lot of group work at the end. Easy to do well.
,,,,,,,,,,,Fun class. Fantastic professor who really cares. One piece of advice— if I were him I’d allow more space to explore “gabfest” conversation type of podcasts as opposed to just scripted NPR types. Those conversational pods are huge.
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you are interested in podcasts but not sure where to start, this is the class for you. Professor Spikes cares about each of his students and wants us to succeed, and he's always there to help. The class itself is fairly easy and self–explanatory, but it's a great elective for people not as interested in traditional journalism and/or want experience in audio. There's some assigned readings but you don't really have to do them, especially if you have a background in audio storytelling. Then there's some smaller assignments over the course of the quarter and two main projects. Overall, I definitely recommend this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a great class for journalism majors who want to take a quarter off from writing. I really like Professor Spikes and he cared a lot about the success of his students by giving helpful feedback. Really recommend if you’re interested in audio and sound editing!
,,,,,,,,,,,Great professor who is really engaged and an easy general medill class if you need.
jour,jour,390,spring,Karin Lydersen,5.60,5.80,5.80,5.80,6.00,11.80,i loved this course! i would only recommend to people interested in becoming a reporter or wanting to report because it involves a lot of real–life journalism work. But this is awesome for someone who wants to be a journalist! great way to get investigative experience as a young reporter
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would recommend this course with Kari to anyone in Medill. She’s an amazing instructor and is so supportive throughout the entire investigative class. I took this class instead of doing my JR, and I’m SO happy I made that decision. The work was really interesting and meaningful, and as long as you stay engaged and do your work you don’t really have to worry about your grade at all."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Kari is really helpful and great! One of the most interesting classes I have taken at Northwestern. If you can't/do not want to do a JR this class was a great replacement. Learned a lot about reporting/journalism, your work makes a real impact and you are essentially doing the same things as a Medill grad student. Cons: it is in Chicago 1–2 times a week which is a big time commitment and commute."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Between the two projects I worked on in this class, I’ve sent over 130 public records requests across the country, deeply researched policies and trends in policing, analyzed massive data sets, and spoke with dozens of sources, PIOs and record keepers. I now have an expert knowledge of police policies, record keeping methods, standards, police reform, and accountability boards in several large US cities, including Chicago. The course was foundational for me and I will carry the skills that I learned throughout the rest of my career."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a really meaningful and rewarding course for me, and I learned a lot. It's a lot of work, but it all culminates into something you can be proud of."
jour,jour,390,winter,Peter Slevin,6.00,5.88,5.88,5.88,5.75,8.00,This is one of the two best classes I've taken at Northwestern. I was able to grow so much and gain expert knowledge on Chicago politics. It will definitely help you narrow in on the type of journalism you would like to pursue and just generally helps you become more knowledgeable on the city and its politics. The class includes lots of trips into Chicago. Class met once a week for 3 hours in a newsroom–like style. Many qualified speakers and politicians spoke to the class. Professor Slevin is a wonderful teacher and helped all of his students to challenge themselves and improve.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is one of the best courses I've taken at Northwestern. It was a lot of work, but it was work that was directly applicable to my future career and I gained so much from taking it. I highly recommend taking this course (or any course) with Peter Slevin."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Slevin is such an amazing teacher and this class was much more exciting than I thought it would be. It's easy to do well on assignments as long as you put in the work. We were lucky to be doing this class around a mayoral election because we got to go into Chicago and attend events around the city that made reporting both easier and more interesting. We got to speak with a lot of professionals both in journalism and in the campaign world and we all worked very collaboratively due to the environment that Slevin created.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Slevin is one of my favorite professors I've ever had. I signed up for this class knowing one of my friends enjoyed a class with him, but I was not interested in politics whatsoever. Slevin has experience in the industry and used it to help us and set us up for success. The biggest mistake I made was not spending enough time throughout the quarter going to election–related activities that weren't directly tied to assignments, I wish I had done more with that. I also wish I had planned better for my final story farther enough in advance, because it took much more time than I expected. Otherwise, I greatly enjoyed this class and Slevin was amazing."
,,,,,,,,,,,Excellent course that allowed me to understand Chicago far better than any class prior. Reporting assignments brought me throughout the city and in front of actual mayoral candidates and into campaign events as well as to polling sites on Election Night.
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Slevin is awesome! Such a knowledgable person and he truly cares about seeing students succeed. He pushed us to be our best by making sure we actually reported IN Chicago and made sure we got on the ground. Feel like I will take away skills from this course that I'll hopefully use as a reporter.
jour,jour,390,winter,Hilary Fung,4.20,4.20,4.30,4.20,3.90,5.91,"I was very excited to take this course given the rise of intersection between design and tech. However, we were not given much actual experience or expertise in creating the visualizations we saw. This course felt more watching than action based."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Cool concepts and lots of great examples. Class is really what you make of it. You get to choose your roles within your team so you can avoid anything you really dislike. However, this means you are never really pushed outside your comfort zone"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was really useful. It was my first nontraditional CS class, but it was so useful! It's cool to learn about the CS implementations in the journalism field."
jour,jour,390,winter,Mei-Ling Hopgood,5.10,5.40,5.20,4.90,5.33,8.20,Probably the best Medill class I've taken so far. Professor Hopgood is the absolute best and makes sure you learn the material. Absolutely recommend
,,,,,,,,,,,nothing worse than 9 ams
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really liked this course! Hopgood is a great prof and has excellent advice and feedback. There are plenty of opportunities to write, which I loved, and lots of freedom."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course will teach you so much about how to build genuine relationships with sources. I feel like I will keep in touch with many of the people I spoke with for these assignments. Class time is a LOT of guest speakers and reworking drafts of stories you're writing. But the actual stories you write are super rewarding. Prof. Mei–Ling graded assignments complete/non–complete which took a lot of stress off the typical 301. You could get pluses for really good work, and I liked that structure a lot. Still made me super motivated to try hard at the class, just for the right reasons (not just grades)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was amazing, Prof. Hopgood really puts in so much effort and care in her responses and edits. The class, for a reporting class, has minimal official articles; instead, it is much more focused on taking a step back and working through the reporting process as well as learning to report on marginalized communities and building relationships with locals. Definitely the best Medill class I have taken so far!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really enjoyed this class. It gave me a chance to do some bilingual reporting and make connections within my own community. Lots of work to report, but you get what you put into it. I am really proud of all that I accomplished this Q with my reporting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"While the class places an emphasis on reporting about Asian Americans, the stories do not necessarily focus heavily on identity. This allowed for the freedom to report on a wide range of topics while learning about journalism surrounding Asian American. The workload is similar to that of JOUR 201–1, but the completion–based grading system reduces the stress that comes with a reporting class."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was fine for a JOUR 301 course and many of the assignments were engaging and fun to complete.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class overall. The assignments were very doable but also interesting, and we could take them in directions that we were most interested in. The work isn't overwhelming at all unless you wait to the last minute to start reporting. Prof. Hopgood brought in some very cool guest speakers. She'd also regularly give us reporting days instead of having us come to class, which was lovely."
jour,jour,390,winter,Fenit Nirappil,5.22,4.78,5.00,5.11,5.00,6.56,"This is a great class. Fenit knows so much about local government reporting and brought in very interesting guest speakers nearly every class. I learned important skills like campaign vetting and pivot tables, which I'm sure will be helpful in my journalism career. Fenit is generally understanding, but expect for him to push you pretty hard and have high standards. This will be a decent amount of work in addition to MOTH, but totally doable if you manage your time and use your long weekends."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot in this class about local investigative journalism and how to be persistent with reporting. Fenit is a really engaged professor and holds his students to high standards. Some assignments can be a little tedious and time consuming, but they're all pretty manageable. I really appreciate all the guest speakers Fenit brought in and how he gave us practical advice about what it's like to be a professional journalist."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really appreciated the more practical skills like using excel and how to vet a candidate. Some of the assignments prof took too seriously and graded harshly.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course covers a great deal of methods, strategies, and hard skills involved in investigative journalism in a relatively short amount of time. Because of this, even though the material is generally useful, it can easily get overwhelming and make you feel defeated when things don't work out. (Things inevitably will not work out, it must be said, since it's virtually impossible to conduct a fruitful investigation in a matter of weeks.) I think with a little reshuffling and restructuring, the course could be made much more manageable for students who are new to investigative reporting, and students who are new to local DC reporting and the structure of DC government — and basically every student falls into at least one of those categories. A little bit of easing into things and more reasonable expectations would go a long way."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Fenit really put a lot of effort into this class, and you can tell. All the assignments had clear applications to the real world, which is something I really appreciated."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was interesting. There were some high points, for sure, but also a lot of low points that I think skewed my perception of the class. Our professor is a highly knowledgeable and talented journalist, and it was evident how much effort he put into the class. He was highly prepared for each class, and brought in a ton of really interesting speakers who could share their experiences with us. Another great thing about him was how reachable he was, always just an email away if we had questions about the assignment or just journalism in general. He also brought in local food for us every week, which I thought was very kind. It was clear, however, that Fenit expected more from us than we were able to give. The class centered around investigative reporting, which Fenit is excellent at. But most of us have never done investigative reporting before, and I think Fenit expected our work to be at his level at all times. Grading was very harsh, unnecessarily so for things like submitting FOIA requests, which is completely new territory for most of us in the class. Additionally, some of the assignments were very long and arduous. Fenit did his best to parse down these assignments and give extensions were possible, which was appreciated. At the end of the day, though, I think I was more stressed out than I should have been, which led me to try and jump through the hoops of the class and took away from my ability to let the material sink in. Overall, I think the class was good, not great. I appreciate all the work Fenit put into the class, and I truly believe he is a kind, talented person. I just wish he used novice expectations for us rather than the expectations that exist for Washington Post reporters."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, this class is good, but it's definitely a little harder than the other two MOTH classes. There are weekly assignment, which can be time–consuming, but they are manageable. Fenit's very knowledgeable in local journalism and puts a lot of effort into each class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class focuses on some really important skills for local accountability reporting, but Fenit just takes it too seriously. Despite this being an evening class to supplement our daily political reporting, Fenit treats it like its our #1 priority and assigns an unreasonable amount of tedious work. Despite being a very nice guy in class (who often brought us dinner from local DC joints, which was very much appreciated), he has unrealistic expectations for the kind of investigative reporting we can accomplish in 2 months without the resources or gravitas of a national newspaper behind our names. Despite dissing the old guard in journalism, Fenit still has that grind mentality that means the class is largely built around the idea that you have to learn the ropes yourself –– but we weren't given the grace to try and fail when it came to grading. The grading often felt random and intentionally harsh, with students getting 3/5 on assignments that were framed as throwaways, and Fenit giving out low grades even if you took his feedback or made it expressly clear that you tried and struggled to get sources to talk."
,,,,,,,,,,,Lots of work but worth it
jour,jour,390,winter,Alex Kotlowitz,4.91,4.55,4.64,4.45,4.91,5.80,"This was a pretty interesting course. A lot of it revolves around reading/hearing/watching examples of oral history and then discussing it in class. We had one shorter assignment interviewing a family member or friend, and we spent a lot of class time critiquing each others' pieces. Then we had a bigger final project creating a collection of oral histories. The assignment descriptions were always a little big vague, but so it gave us a lot of freedom to write what we want."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I've never written in an oral history format, and I ended up totally loving it. The readings, podcasts and videos we were assigned were super interesting and expanded my view of what oral history as journalism could look like. The writing assignments (1 short oral history, 3 longer ones as the final) were applicable to what we were learning and I found them enjoyable to report on and write, and not too time–consuming. There was a lot of freedom in picking topics, and while that was nice for people like myself that liked my topic and had success in reporting, there were some people that had to scrap their final projects two weeks before the end of the quarter. If you're taking this course, make sure you like your story idea and that it will work as oral history as soon as possible!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Kotlowitz is a great professor willing to share some of his really neat experiences in the field. Great class for learning how to tell someone's personal story and become a stronger interviewer. One of the more enjoyable and fulfilling Medill classes I've taken.
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was the first time Professor Kotlowitz taught this class, and I thought it was fantastic. If you have the opportunity to take any class taught by Kotlowitz, I strongly suggest you do. His knowledge and experience in the field and his feedback on our stories was invaluable. The whole class was just two assignments, one short story and one quarter–long story. If you have a good story idea, this class will be a lot of fun, so the work on the front end is the most important part. Since it was the first time being taught, Kotlowitz will surely change/add things to the class, but I'm sure it will only be for the best."
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a really interesting course that focused on a really cool side of journalism that I hadn't really thought much about before. This was really helpful for thinking about and working on interviewing and editing!
,,,,,,,,,,,"The readings/ audio pieces were really cool, and so I enjoyed doing the work. However, I do feel like our short pieces for class were sometimes compared to the life's work of professional journalists. Alex is a wonderful professor but his expectations were sometimes confusing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is by far the best Medill class I've taken. Professor Kotlowitz is so unbelievably knowledgeable and talented in his field, which is literally the subject matter of the course. He's tough but fair, and constantly pushes you to be better (which can be frustrating). Still, he's the kind of guy I feel lucky to have learned from. Nobody better."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great class! Professor Kotlowitz is a great teacher who gives meaningful and important feedback to assignments. All the readings we did were so interesting, and our class discussions were great. The class also involved a lot of workshopping, which was intimidating but helpful. Overall, a great class that taught me a lot. It's also a great class to take if you don't love typical / traditional reporting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I wasn't expecting much from this course, but even still, it let me down. Alex is an accomplished journalist and great professor, but he really was unpredictable in which story ideas he liked and which ones he didn't, and it often felt like he was trying to extract some trauma from the people we were interviewing. There was a short assignment interviewing a friend or family member, a presentation on one of the readings, and a final oral history project containing at least three interviews. My classmates and I felt discouraged when pitching our final projects, and it ultimately made me feel like nothing I could write would satisfy his expectations. The 3–hour class was also incredibly draining each week. But I stayed with the class and didn't drop because the other electives looked even less promising, so in all, this isn't the worst class to take."
comm,comm_st,101,fall,James Schwoch,4.03,3.63,2.75,2.41,3.55,3.26,"Unfortunately this class has been a terrible first impression of COMM studies at Northwestern. I know this class is not indicative of the department, but still, this class has been a genuinely frustrating experience. Instruction style is quite rambly, with the prof not even looking up enough to realize that no one is paying attention. Lecture content was the same one or two concepts for all 9 weeks of instruction, and clearly constructed from the professor's personal research interests rather than the supposed class curriculum."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The way the class is set up, it gives you so much freedom to do assignments. I love it! I am able to write when I have the time to write because the deadlines are spaced out."
,,,,,,,,,,,I was not sure what I was supposed to retain from this class. It didn't feel organized and the material didn't seem to connect. I think that it was supposed to be a broad overview of communications but I feel like we only talked about climate change.
,,,,,,,,,,,"A lot of current events were discussed, which I enjoyed, but I found I got more out of the readings and discussions than the lectures often."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Honestly did not understand the goal of this course as the lectures don't have anything to do with assignments, and there are no exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,Easy A though if you do the homework.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I cannot stress how boring this course (and the instructor) is. Every single lecture he will put you through 50 minutes of presentation about a lame topic that has nothing to do with the homework assignments. The only good thing about this course is that it barely has any work; only 5 short, easy assignments and 1 500–1000 word essay at the end."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I wasn't sure what this course was supposed to be teaching. The discussions, assignments, and lectures felt disconnected and it was an extremely easy class, but the content and substance was lacking. Still an enjoyable course, but felt like it did not do a good job of giving an overview of the field of communications. I know someone who changed their major due to the fuzzy nature of communications that they got as an impression from this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is not really structured. Prof Schwoch will talk about news articles/videos/scholarly papers around a very broad concept of ""communication studies"", which is mildly interesting sometimes, but I often don't get the point. There's not much assignments and readings to worry about; three short papers and a SoC event report are all you need to worry about during the quarter"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The assignments were very manageable. Lots of reading. Because communication is present in almost everything we do, it's easy to connect what you learn in class to your other courses. I often found myself asking the significance of certain readings and assignments to the major, but overall, this course encourages one's exploration of SoC and all its opportunities."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Lecture was extremely confusing –– majority of students (including myself) didn't realize course was about climate change until the second or third week, and content is not really presented in a way that's engaging. Homework is VERY easy and doesn't have anything to do with the lecture content, and discussion sessions don't really do much. I know this is the first year the comms department is offering this class after revising the curriculum, but it's honestly pretty unnecessary and is two classes that could've been used to do something else. Instructor is passionate about the subject but it's hard to get anyone engaged."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Schwoch is really enthusiastic. The lectures are okay, but sometimes the topics feel random. The homework is easy and there are no midterms or exams which is nice."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a good intro to comm studies course. There are no exams, just a few assignments throughout the quarter. It's nice that you get to meet all the other comm studies freshmen and discuss topics with them, but I do wish there was a bit more structure to the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was a lot of fluff and was not obviously specific to any sphere of communication studies. It did not help me get any closer to finding exactly what communication means in any context.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was chronically unfocused. Course materials failed to relay any meaningful, conceptual information about communication. Instead, we read random news articles about climate change and saw slideshows about random historical events. These out–of–class readings and in–class lessons never related to one another, and they both lacked any cohesive topic. Homework consisted of a half–dozen one–sentence writing prompts scattered throughout the quarter, producing a trivially easy courseload. I could not say how any of these vague assignments related to communication or any other aspect of the course. This class was a waste of time."
,,,,,,,,,,,"A lot of students share the same thoughts in that we did not see the main point in the class. The curriculum just did not seem to be focusing on one specific things, it was kind of all over the place and we did not see how it related to our major."
,,,,,,,,,,,NA
,,,,,,,,,,,"It is important to me to have a nonstressful learning space, and this class provided that."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, this course wasn't what I expected it to be. I thought it would be more of an overview of different disciplines of communication studies, but instead it felt more like an environmental science class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVED this class, the professor and TAs were knowledgeable and super nice! It was easy to get help and clarification when I struggled with something. The topics taught were also very interesting, the professor was very enthusiastic, which made the class more fun"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a very chill class, yet it informed me about helpful topics as a communications student. This course's discussion sections also helped me connect with my fellow classmates and transition into college life."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The discussion section was the best part of the course. We were able to talk about global, environmental, and political issues as young adults and there were very good conversations. The lectures however never really resonated with me, they were too specific to the interests of the professor."
comm,comm_st,101,winter,James Schwoch,4.25,3.62,3.07,2.62,3.61,3.40,This class was an unfocused mess. Nearly half of classes in the quarter were cancelled for miscellaneous reasons. We learned nothing all quarter because the professor was unprepared and rambling. The sole assignment in the entire quarter was a group research project with almost nonexistent guidelines. Every class was unenjoyable and awkward.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a complete waste of time, and there is no need for it to be two quarters. It gave me such a bad impression of the communications major as a whole that I decided to switch majors. Even after two quarters, I could not figure out what the class was supposed to be about or how any of the material related to communication studies. Prof seems nice, and the only good thing about this class was that it was virtually no work."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I know this is a new course for first–year communication studies students to take and that it is required, however, I write this urging the department of Comm Studies to discontinue this course. It in no way brought any sort of education on the field of Communications as a whole and it merely was a twice–a–week lecture where Professor Schwoch would talk about whatever he was interested in. The course culminated in an end–of–quarter research assignment that was essentially the level of an elementary school research project. There is already a Research Methods in Communications Studies class, so this class should not be necessary nor forced to be taken by all comm studies freshmen."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Schwoch is a nice guy. No midterm or final
,,,,,,,,,,,This class had a very small workload. The entire course was preparing for a group presentation at the end of the quarter and writing a research paper in a group of about 10 people. I wish there would have been more substance in this course because I don't think there was enough work to fill the quarter.
,,,,,,,,,,,I was able to improve my research skills! The professor is enthusiastic about each topic which made the class a lot more interesting!
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is very easy– it was all centered around one big research paper/presentation, so if you stay on top of your part it's super easy. The topic doesn't always immediately seem relevant to communications studies so it is easy to feel lost but if you go to discussion/talk to the prof. then you'll be fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,I don't think I learned anything in this class. All we did was work outside of class in our small groups to finish a shared paper. The professor tried to provide help but it was just really confusing.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The teacher is very nice, but unclear."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is based on a research project that you get put into groups for. Not very time consuming, found some interesting things."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course helped me to learn more about natural disasters and how to work on a 10 page research paper with my classmates.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course including the work load and the professor. Everyone was really nice and super willing to work and meet outside of class time. The course load itself is very minimal throughout the quarter, which I really appreciated during this winter quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Again like COMM 101–1, I'm not sure what I was supposed to get out of this class. We created a paper based on a natural disaster or event, but this was not related to Communications. We didn't have class for like 3 of the weeks and also did not receive grades back at all at any time. He is an easy grader, so I'm not super worried but this was not the case last quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I wish my group wasn't so big, it was more than 6 people and we needed to write a paper which was very challenging"
,,,,,,,,,,,I love Professor Schwoch but the class itself was very easy and not very intellectually stimulating. He is a great man and a good person to know but be prepared to not really take much away.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The purpose of this class is to inform students on how to conduct research, and I believe it did anything but that. The information presented to us in class explained little to nothing on how to carry out the tasks presented to us, and it seemed a bit like busy work at times. My biggest frustration with this class is that the significance of communication was rarely explained or talked about by our instructors."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There was a paper project that was the worst assignment I've done in awhile. It was a group paper/presentation and the biggest problem was there was WAY too many people. The idea was not being well done, the paper was slapped together as there were just too many people, and there were issues of agreeing on things so the end result was a project not many were happy or proud of. It was a painful process"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was interesting, but was not my favourite."
,,,,,,,,,,,"again, a pretty useless class that you just have to suffer through. whole class was in preparation for a final project on a natural disaster with a group –– group sizes were widely uneven, super hard to distribute work, and very little instruction on how to do the actual project. comms department should look into replacing this class with something with more substance rather than just ""oh hey guys, let's work on your final project!"""
comm,comm_st,102,fall,Nash Jenkins,5.46,5.25,4.33,3.85,5.00,3.31,"Pretty much all we did was write and deliver speeches to the class. So, if you are a decent public speaker or think you can become one, this will be an easy class. However, I can imagine that if you struggle with public speaking, this course might be a difficult one to get the hang of. With that being said, Nash is a really understanding professor and will do everything he can to help you get better. Even if you struggle in the beginning, in the end, it's hard to imagine someone wouldn't get an A in this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class was very laid back, making it a fun and relaxing course! The environment for doing speeches was friendly and welcoming."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you are able to take this course with Professor Nash, you definitely should! Nash is such an amazing instructor, he helps provide a very comfortable learning environment which is key in a public speaking course. Overall, in this class, you’re able to make mistakes and not get punished for them and it’ll help you become the best speaker you can be."
,,,,,,,,,,,Very laidback teacher who tends to give good grades. Class environment is super chill. Your grades are based on 5 short discussion posts and 6 speeches of different types. You only have to work during the weeks you're assigned to give a speech; the rest there are barely any work.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Nash was dope, super chill and understanding. He had good feedback and direction without it being stressful or hard. I did end up becoming more comfortable with public speaking, so overall I call it a win."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was an excellent public speaking course. Class time was usually discussion about reading/audios/videos we were given as homework. There were different types of speeches we learned about (narrative, informative, persuasive) and the final was just a longer speech that you could pick anything. We were given feedback groups so you could give tips to peers and overall I honestly feel more confident talking in front of people now."
,,,,,,,,,,,Good class! You get to talk about basically whatever you want
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think the structure of making this class relaxed was a perfect learning environment. Nash was very personable and walked the talk with his eloquence. To be honest, the largest learning I gained was from simply hearing the ways people articulated differently, and I would say the class was definitely helpful in boosting my confidence in speaking."
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this class. It was low stress and really allowed me to comfortably explore public speaking and improve my skills
comm,comm_st,102,fall,Sarah Idzik,5.92,5.69,5.46,4.62,5.69,3.00,"Take this class with Sarah! She is such a kind and wonderful person, and I'm so glad I took it with her. She makes every class fun and meaningful and you also will learn a ton from her. She does a great job analyzing where you currently are in terms of public speaking and giving actionable steps for improvement. I was consistently impressed by how well she organized and ran the class. This was easily one of my favorite classes I've taken at Northwestern, and I'm saying this as someone who is not a natural public speaker."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Idzik does a great job helping you become more conscious of your self when giving speeches and you do learn techniques to improve your skills. I'd say it's a pretty good class to take even if it's not required.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was dreading taking this class, but Sarah was an amazing professor. She created a light hearted, judgement free atmosphere, and the whole class is supportive of one another. There are three planned speeches total with a few non–graded impromptu speeches throughout the quarter, but after the first ones, they are so low–stress. The in class activities really made this class so much better than I anticipated."
,,,,,,,,,,,The class focused on different public speaking skills every class. I always found it relevent and helpful.
,,,,,,,,,,,I thoroughly enjoyed this course! Professor was extremely helpful with feedback on speeches and I genuinely felt that I improved as the course went on.
,,,,,,,,,,,Sarah was a fantastic professor. She made everyone feel comfortable and there was a great balance of fun and helpful lessons. I learned to think about aspects of my public speaking that I hadn't before and I saw improvement in myself
,,,,,,,,,,,"Sarah is so sweet! She is enthusiastic during every class and genuinely wants her students to improve their speaking abilities. There are three ""big"" speeches, fun group activities, and impromptu speeches. The content was pretty simple (rhetoric, pathos/ethos/logos, basically stuff you learn in English class), but having the chance to practice speaking in front of others was nice."
,,,,,,,,,,,professor Idzik is the best professor you can ask for this course. TAKE IT WITH HER
,,,,,,,,,,,"A pretty fun course – low workload but the work was high–stress (public speaking), learned a lot about how to focus on my presentation to an audience. The class really makes you consider each aspect of speaking."
,,,,,,,,,,,"so fun and chill, really fun. good class and intimate which we all liked from the looks of it too. important stuff to learn but it is provided in a chill environment."
comm,comm_st,102,fall,Eva Rubens Celem,3.67,3.70,3.70,3.50,3.67,5.00,"If you're an engineering major, you've probably heard that public speaking ranges from classes where the professor hands out As, to classes where... that doesn't happen. Even though this class was probably towards the latter side of that range, I actually came out of the class learning a lot. Yes, you will have to do the readings and make sure you understand them; you also want to ensure that you actually satisfy all the criteria on the rubrics. But this class will really ensure that you grow as a speaker. Prof. Celem was excellent, and very passionate about having us learn. Highly recommend taking it with her class."
,,,,,,,,,,,I liked this class. I thought the readings were super helpful and you walk out of the class with an amazing life skill of being able to publicly speak. I think everyone should take this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"To me, the most important aspect of this course was feeling comfortable in front of an audience. The professor, however made this course more about things that aren’t necessary in public speech"
,,,,,,,,,,,Lots of speaking including impromptu and prepared.
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's definitely manageable to get an A as long as you do all the work and especially make the deadlines. If you have the chance to take it with a professor who has better ctecs, I would do that because it can make the class much more enjoyable. It's not a huge time commitment but professor rubens can make it feel stressful because she can be unnecessarily strict. There are 3 speeches that make the bulk of your grade, and as along as you show improvement with each one, your grade will be fine. There are also other fun activities and pretty much a warm up every single class, so be prepared to speak each time. If you are not a fan of speaking or being more extroverted, do NOT take this class as a distro."
,,,,,,,,,,,I felt like she made a public speaking class something we took in HS to mean the world. Very strict with grading and assignments and unnecessarily rude and sarcastic.
comm,comm_st,102,fall,Ryan Bince,5.71,5.64,4.86,4.14,5.57,3.86,This is a really great course to take for any reason at all. The workload is fairly minimal and there is a lot to take out of the class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"i got to mess around with ""parody"" speeches that were on unconventional topics while still practicing the same base concepts and ideas"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I cannot emphasize this enough: TAKE THIS CLASS WITH RYAN!!!! His teaching was the best I've ever experienced at Northwestern. His class is truly focused on learning and developing realistic skills for public speaking. You learn some of the most practical and applicable skills you could ever need in the professional/corporate world, but in a really fun and engaging way. I took this class at 9am and I still looked forward to it every day, so if that doesn't prove that you need to take this class with Ryan, I don't know what does. RYAN IS AMAZING at teaching, super accommodating, and hilarious so I will miss this class a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,Probably one of the lowest maintenance classes you'll have to take as an engineer. Ryan was amazing and if I could take another course with him I would.
,,,,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed this class. There was a mix of impromptu and prepared speaking and the professor graded relatively easy. There were plenty of fun speaking activities that made class something to look forward to. I barely did any work for this class besides practicing speeches.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Bince is really awesome. Kind, understanding, very knowledgable. While the class is just super easy, I still found it somehow enjoyable and a positive experience."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great course overall, and touched on many different topics. The professor did a great job at teaching and is very nice and flexible."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course was fine, it was a good easy course where you basically just had to show up to get participation points which were 60% of our grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,One of the best courses I have taken at Northwestern. Definitely take this class with Prof. Bince! He is a great prof and super accommodating to his students.
,,,,,,,,,,,Super fun and relaxing class
,,,,,,,,,,,"Awesome course. Purposeful, clear, chill, fun, and well–executed. I wish Ryan could teach my engineering classes. I cannot imagine having had a better experience in any other public speaking section."
comm,comm_st,102,fall,Callie Sartain,5.89,5.71,4.47,3.24,5.76,3.00,"This course impressed me. I enjoyed it more than I anticipated. Callie is a great instructor and is very understanding. In terms of material, most people have probably encountered close to everything in past courses, including high school. I appreciated the environment and the practice giving speeches."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great course all around. There was no attendance policy, I could have just skipped half the classes and still gotten an A, but I wanted to go to each class to learn. Public speaking is such a key skill and this class teaches it well. The professor was awesome too."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you need public speaking as a major requirement, take it with Callie. She's amazing and understanding. Honestly was an easy A as long as you participate and complete the speech assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Interesting to learn about some theory/terminology for public speaking for things considered common knowledge. Very laid back approach and Callie is really understanding/accommodating. I also liked how she allows visual aids such as powerpoints, which I feel is a very useful type of speaking, especially for engineering majors going into the world. She is the best teacher by far! No stress."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was great. Very low stress and because of that it made it easy to try to get better at speaking skills rather than being nervous to do well for a grade. Callie was a great professor for this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was a laid back class that allowed me to focus on my other core classes. Kalny did a very good job in making sure that the class was stress free. We gave a total of 4 speeches throughout the quarter and we were given plenty of time to prepare. Outside of speeches we did weekly journals of at least 250 words about class that week, which takes less than 30 minutes to write."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this course with Callie if you can! She has a really great perspective on public speaking and made this process as easygoing as possible for students. Attendance is flexible, though I found myself wanting to go to class because I enjoyed it. The speeches are really lowkey and there are about 5 in the quarter. Great instructor."
,,,,,,,,,,,"this course is great. It is easy, but I still feel like I learned. What I appreciate the most is how the speeches were fun to give. The types of speeches were varied and it was fun to come up with any topic to present on. There was time for most of the work to be completed in class. The improv workshop was fun. The instructor is very kind, informative and understanding. Her style of teaching is great."
,,,,,,,,,,,Callie is great! I enjoyed this class and felt that I grew a lot as a public speaker.
comm,comm_st,102,winter,Eva Rubens Celem,5.14,4.86,4.29,3.43,5.57,4.00,"This was a great course! You are given the tools to succeed as a public speaker, but in my opinion 10~ weeks isn't enough to transform you to become a great speaker. The grading was not too harsh so finding success is quite simple Just finish your assignments and you will be fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,Unnecessarily long and complicated a skill that truly is just about getting up and speaking in front of a crowd.
,,,,,,,,,,,I am not sure if this class helped me improve as a speaker but it was helpful to speak in a public setting because I had never gotten the opportunity to do so before.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Super easy, super fun, nice break from all the engineering classes"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a requirement for engineers and sections fill up quick so it really doesn't matter what the CTECs say. I'm not sure if it was just this section, but there was quite a lot expected per week for what it was (book readings, outlines, responses, an out of class observation, and of course preparation for speeches). I will say that Eva did a good job at teaching the course. She cared a lot about the content and I really appreciated her thoughtful comments on every assignment."
comm,comm_st,102,winter,Emily Andrews,5.86,5.43,4.64,3.57,5.64,3.28,"Definitely take Public Speaking with Erin if you can! She's very understanding of everyone's circumstances, and she is a great point of contact for any questions you might have on the speech assignments. She is also very quick to providing lots of feedback, which helped me quite a lot throughout this course! Lectures were all very relevant to the assignments, and this class does not take too much time outside of class, either. The speech assignments were enjoyable, and definitely attend the guest lecture for impromptu speeches, super fun!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Great course! Emily is a fantastic instructor – super nice and patient. Overall structure is a speech about every two weeks but it's very low stakes and pretty fun. Just a really nice course that makes you more comfortable with public speaking and doesn't take up much time outside of class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Andrews is super sweet, would recommend taking it with her. Easy A and not much work."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class created a fun environment where I felt comfortable speaking in front of my peers. It challenged me to go outside of my comfort zone, but I felt like I learned a lot in the end and had fun along the way."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I took this class because I had a crippling fear of public speaking (had no requirement to do so). I think the continual speech practice really helped me overcome this fear (I still get anxious but I at least now know that I have the skills to effectively public speak). On another note, please take this class with Emily! She is so kind and does a great job of creating a safe space. She offered really helpful feedback after each speech and made an active effort to make this class as painless as possible."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I came to this class with great fear of giving presentations/speeches. I had huge fear, no kidding. This class really helps me a lot in improving my speaking skills and overcome my fear of speaking in front of people. Some speeches are really helpful, like the self–introduction and the elevator pitch, which are very practical. The gradings are very generous and Emily is a very encouraging instructor, always willing to help and giving positive feedback. 10/10!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Emily was a super nice and very encouraging instructor. My public speaking skills definitely improved after taking this class
,,,,,,,,,,,Just practicing public speaking as much as we did in this class helped so much. I highly recommend taking this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class, if you have to take this class with anyone, take it with professor Andrews. She really nice and do not grade harshly. She also provides great feedback. Overall, chill experience!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"emily is a great teacher! very accomodating, chill, and pretty flexible speech topics. attendance mandatory only on speech days, 6 speeches total. would 5/5 recommend!"
comm,comm_st,102,winter,Skylar Clark,5.14,5.17,3.57,2.57,4.86,3.57,"Skylar is a fantastic teacher and someone who I would definitely recommend taking this course with. Her class time was very interactive and stimulating, and even though the class was 2 hours long it certainly did not feel like it. Her feedback on speeches is very constructive and helpful, and her grading is definitely fair and lenient. 10/10"
,,,,,,,,,,,"3 speeches (3–4 min, 4–5 min, 6–8 min), skill share day, impromptu speeches, few writing assignments. Class gave a lot of insight on tips to help improve organization and delivery of speeches. Very enjoyable class to take and not a lot of time commitment."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great intro course for comm and is easy only have 3 speeches and small projects.
,,,,,,,,,,,"You're probably taking this because it's required but fun class, would recommend"
comm,comm_st,102,winter,John Brooks,5.27,4.87,4.13,3.53,5.13,3.53,"The class feels catered to each individual's progress rather than a set goal for everyone. Therefore, there is time for 1–on–1 discussions to fit your needs."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Mixed feelings about the course. Some of the lecture content was interesting, and helped me think about public speaking differently. I felt that often our speeches were just trying to please the instructor rather than developing our own style better. The approach to speaking was very clearly US–centric and lacked space for other cultural expressions. The very distinct, polarized ""for–against"" stance is outdated and doesn't truly reflect the complexities of discussing any topic rigorously. The speeches could have been a much better experience if we had adopted peer feedback instead. I don't want to stand in a room full of 20 people and talk for 5 to 8 minutes just to appease the instructor's way of what standard speech should look like. I felt very odd about how much projection there was from the teaching side, and trying to relate to each and everything that was being said. This felt like a high–school debate camp rather than a course I'd expect to see at Northwestern."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's fine, good chill class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Easy class and the teacher was chill. We were able to work on our speeches in class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"John was great, he made the classroom feel like an extremely inviting and accepting space which made speeches a lot easier to give"
comm,comm_st,102,winter,Christopher Dobmeier,6.00,6.00,5.58,4.50,5.83,3.00,It was important for me to learn and be more confident in myself when presenting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class, I would recommend taking with Chris"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Chris is a gem. He is an amazing instructor that cares about his students. He will go above and beyond helping you with preparing for your speech and feeling more comfortable speaking in front of the class. Chris provides a safe environment and most of the people in the class have connected because of that. This section being majority student athletes, he was very accommodating and understanding. He makes this class self–graded, but offers feedback after each speech. Even though our section was scheduled for an hour and 50, he never took up the entire time, usually only going an hour and 30 at most. Take this class with Chris and you will have the best time ever!!!!!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would definitely recommend taking this class with Chris. Overall, classes are very laid–back with lots of partner and small group activities where you get to interact with your classmates. The speeches also intentionally have very broad prompts (informative, persuasive, and a final speech that gives a unique perspective), which lets you pick topics you might be more interested in. Chris is a great lecturer, accommodating to students with conflicts, and gives helpful feedback on each of your speeches too. Overall, take this class with Chris – you won't regret it"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class! Chris is an excellent teacher, and the exercises and materials taught were very helpful. There was also barely any work, making it a fun class to look forward to each week!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great prof, fun classes. The speeches were great practice in every step of researching, writing, and presenting a speech. I loved picking my own topics for the speeches. That really helped motivate the quality of my speeches."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is SUPER easy. It is self graded and consisted on 3 speeches. The professor was AMAZING and super ice. I learned a bunch of skills to help me with public speaking. Overall a super chill course with an awesome teacher. Definitely recommend.
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you have to take Public Speaking, take it with Chris— he's the best professor for this!! Super kind and chill guy, super understanding, and extremely flexible."
comm,comm_st,102,winter,Annika Pinch,5.91,5.64,5.00,4.45,5.82,4.09,"I took this course as part of my McCormick degree requirements, and I found it to be a reasonable amount of work. From what I can tell, the workload is very instructor dependent, but Annika made the course low–stress. We had 3 major speeches and a variety of minor activities/speeches, but Annika prepares you well and gives thorough feedback."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Annika Pinch did a great job making the class a comfortable place to practice public speaking. Each class had 2–4 low–pressure activities to practice mainly in groups. There were also 3 major speeches (5–8 mins). While you probably know most of the skills through high school/college speeches, the class is helpful practice to reduce anxiety and a reminder to incorporate them into speaking."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was really fun! Annika is amazing and made public speaking very easy! We had a great classroom environment. The class consisted of small written assignments and three major speeches!
,,,,,,,,,,,Loved this course! A very important subject for most students and super fun class. The most time consuming part of the course is practicing the speeches.
,,,,,,,,,,,It was much better than I expected. I enjoyed it and it was pretty fun at times
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was surprisingly my favorite class I've taken at Northwestern. As an engineer, I definitely wasn't expecting it, but it's a class that is fun, interesting, and in my opinion valuable in getting more confident as a speaker."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved public speaking with Annika!!! She was very supportive. As someone who was scared to do public speaking, the class was super inviting and chill when it comes to speech preparation and presentations. My classmates were so supportive. If you take the time to work on your speeches and put in your best effort, you will get the A."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I came in pretty well–versed in public speaking. As someone with a decent amount of experience, all the lessons I've learned thus far were hammered home in this course. The class was fun, lighthearted, and effective in teaching public speaking. Not a lot of work. 2 minute long speeches and then 3 speeches that ranged from 5 to 8 minutes. Peer critiques on other's speeches and some (optional) reading is the only other work. You get to pick your own topics. Lovely class, would recommend to anyone."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Annika was great! You have two short speeches and three longer speeches, along with class activities and participation, that make up your grade. It's a nice, small, supportive environment to practice public speaking."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was amazing. The class was comprised of 3 big speeches and 2 mini speeches. These were all not very intensive and didn't really require much. Most of the emphasis on the speeches was on how you presented yourself rather the content, so the class was not super challenging academically. It was important to know how to structure and organize your speeches though. Each day, we did some group activities in class, which usually resulted in some sort of improv activity. These were helpful as they helped us get warmed up to each other so that we could be comfortable giving speeches to each other. They also helped me grow as a public speaker because of how many times we had to step outside of our comfort zone. Annika is definitely one of the best teachers to take this with, so if you have the option, take it with her!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Public speaking with Annika was amazing! Every class is so fun and the 2 hours flys by. 3 major speeches with outlines & feedback and 2 minor speeches are the only assignments so very manageable workload.
comm,comm_st,102,spring,Ryan Bince,5.92,5.85,5.69,4.77,5.85,3.27,It’s a very fun course
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Bince is the best professor I have ever had the privilege of taking a class with, and that's not an exaggeration. The way he structures class makes the 2 hours go by so fast, and I swear it feels like I'm having too much fun learning because he often incorporates engaging activities into his exercises (like a Haiku slam or playing Mafia). All that being said, I can honestly say I walked away from this class as a better public speaker, as every class he has us speak at least once in front of the group. The homework assignments are chill and sparse, with little to no reading. The speeches we give are also pretty laid back, and Prof. Bince is cool with us taking the speeches in a more unserious and humorous route so long as we actually practice our public speaking skills. Overall, if I could give you one piece of advice, TAKE THIS CLASS WITH BINCE."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Going into the course, I was skeptical about how much it could help. It ended up helping my confidence tremendously and I learned a great deal without having to put in that much effort."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was the most enjoyable class I have taken at Northwestern. Even if class was at 9 am, I still looked forward to it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I can't think of a better communications class. Ample practice with helpful lectures on how to craft speeches, pitches, and presentations helped me become a better public speaker! Great environment made me confident in my own abilities, with a deep understanding of not only what rhetorical theory is –– but how to effectively execute its implementation in engineering, daily life, and planned speeches. An invaluable class taught by a gem of a professor."
,,,,,,,,,,,Ryan is great. Take the class with him.
,,,,,,,,,,,I really liked the professor as he was always really friendly and enthusiastic.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely take public speaking with Ryan! He always found a way to make class entertaining, which is a nice change of pace from the other McCormick classes. Public Speaking is even sometimes the highlight of the week. Adding on, he is also a really good lecturer as well. Even though this was a 9 am class, this class was very energetic, so all class sessions we had were fun."

,,,,,,,,,,,The class was a lot of fun. Nash was a great teacher.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Nash is a fantastic instructor, he provided excellent feedback all the time and loved the way he structured the class. Taking the class with him has been such a pleasure!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Nash is great. Take this class with him if you can. Very relaxed but learnt a lot.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Public speaking was a great class. I was able to practice my public speaking, and I definitely felt like I improved since the start of the quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really effective class. Teaches you necessary skills for speech, but there is a lot of leniency. Nash is a great professor and understands students. But he still pushes you to learn and apply knowledge into your speeches."
comm,comm_st,102,spring,Daniel Fitzmier,5.30,5.30,4.90,4.30,5.20,4.20,"This course helped me to improve my speaking abilities and speak writing abilities. The first speech was a little scary, but the professor created a welcoming environment and it was a judgement free space."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Initially, this course was challenging for me. Public speaking was an activity I'd avoid due to personal concern, nervousness, & worry. This course taught me how to embrace all the attributes that contribute to delivering a formidable speech."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Fitzmeir was an amazing professor and he's also the debate coach so he a particularly invested enjoyment out of teaching the class. Having an 8–minute speech each week was sometimes a little cumbersome but manageable. My favorite assignment was during the last two weeks of class we did a debate which as one can expect was particularly interesting when you have the debate coach assisting you.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Incredible opportunity to improve speaking skills with a lot of feedback opportunities. Professor Fitzmier takes the class very seriously and gives very constructive criticism on every speech, allowing you to improve a lot during the quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,The class is very straightforward: 8 speeches and 2 improvement scores to assess how much you've improved. Professor Fitzmier provides good feedback and is pretty generous with the grading which makes it an Easy A if you put in the required effort. I would definitely recommend taking if you can get in
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great course, it was a requirement, but this requirement made sense. Professor Fitzmier helped provide helpful feedback that made us interact with one another and become stronger public speakers."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I found this class to be not that bad but I felt like class time could have been used more effectively. With this professor, we had to give weekly speeches with the longest speeches being 8 minutes long. Each class was made up of hearing other people's speeches or giving your own speech. I personally didn't think weekly speeches were that bad but if going up to present is really nerve–wrecking then I would suggest maybe a different professor. While I think I did somewhat improve in my speech skills, I felt like I didn't gain much from hearing other people's speeches. Easy class to get through though and the professor was nice (he is also the NU debate coach so he was just always very passionate about public speaking)."
comm,comm_st,102,spring,Jamie Cooley,5.17,5.17,3.92,2.92,4.50,3.33,"This course is a pretty easy one. Show up, try your best, and it will go well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very chill class. It's fun to hear your classmates speak on a topic. Speech is a little subjective, but that's the same for most things. Super low workload."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a fun course that encouraged me to talk about topics I found interesting that were unrelated to academics. I had a lot of creative freedom which sometimes stressed me out (because I wanted to pick the perfect topic for my speech) but ultimately led to a rewarding experience.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Instructor Cooley was very chill, definitely take public speaking with her! It was a very easy class and really enjoyable."
,,,,,,,,,,,NA
,,,,,,,,,,,Public speaking go brr.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was fun! I'm assuming the experience depends on the instructor, but I've always heard good things so I was pretty confident that it would be easy/low–stress. We did 3 speeches and 1 class of impromptu speech exercises, nothing too crazy and it was really fun listening to other students' stories :)"
comm,comm_st,102,spring,Ashley Ferrell,5.80,5.50,5.00,3.90,5.00,3.40,"Great class and will certainly make you a better public speaker along with allowing you to dissect public speeches more effectively. Professor Ferrell is super kind, considerate, and has a deep bag of games/activities to do in class that help you become a better speaker."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Fairly relaxed class, four major assignments and light reading, and Ashley is very understanding and flexible. The lectures aren’t very useful but the impromptu exercises are helpful if a little scary. Ashley provided great feedback after every assignment and I think it really helped me improve as a speaker."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was an easy, fun class that also taught me a lot about public speaking. Ashley was well–prepared, engaging, and very helpful in class and feedback. Would highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This obviously really depends on the teacher you have for this class. If you have to take public speaking, take it with Ashley if she ever teaches it again. She's great, very knowledgeable, fun, willing to talk and help. Always made class engaging and interesting through activities that helped cement the topics. Fair grading, always clear expectations."
,,,,,,,,,,,Pretty easy course. Just three speeches. Was actually much more enjoyable than I expected.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Ashley Ferrell is a good prof. She perhaps makes the course a bit more dry/serious than it needs to be but she is fair, understanding, and a good teacher."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this course with Ashley if you can. She made most of the classes interesting, and created a great environment to speak in. Coursework was very manageable and she was super accommodating too!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was incredibly manageable and interesting because of Professor Ferrell. We talked about really interesting subjects and often played engaging games in class. We also shared some engaging discussions. This is definitely a stress–free class as long as you keep up with the assignments.

She is very welcoming and supportive, and she creates an environment conducive to getting over your fears of public speaking. The assignments were straightforward and as long as you get the work done it's pretty easy to get an A in the course. Professor Andrews also gives good feedback but doesn't put pressure on you to do anything but try your best."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was really good! Emily was an amazing instructor. Classes were two hours long twice a week but we'd get to leave a lot earlier once the stuff we actually needed to learn was taught. There was no busy work nor any random lecture topics that aren't relevant. There were 5 speeches each with a short reflection that were super reasonable and straightforward, and that was it. I was in another public speaking class that had a bunch of useless assignments and content taught in lectures, so I dropped it thinking that it should be better with someone else. With Emily, it was exactly what I was looking for in a public speaking class. Definitely take it with Emily if you can!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The speeches are great, some more difficult than others. The workshops throughout the quarter really help you prepare for the speeches to come. Great class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Informative lessons with speeches every other week: impromptu, persuasive, informative, etc. Good instruction. Emily Andrews makes sure to create opportunities for feedback, both from her and from peers. The content is very conceptual, but it's a fun and valuable class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Emily was awesome and fun class
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course provided a lot of real experience when it came public speaking. It was helpful in pushing me to go past the uncomfortable. The speeches had a reasonable range but I think the last one and the second were perhaps too similar. Overall, it was a great course!"
,,,,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed taking this class with this instructor. She lets us speak about basically anything we want and her grading is pretty chill.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great professor! If you have to take this course for your public speaking requirement, definitely recommend with her. Overall a pretty chill course with 5 total speeches."
comm,comm_st,102,spring,Karl Bullock,5.43,5.00,4.50,3.67,5.18,3.57,"Karl was great! The class was very easy, but in a way that made speaking in front of peers great. The in class activities were really helpful in building confidence."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was ridiculously chill and good vibes. Pretty minimal workload while still helping me learn how to be a better public speaker and notice patterns that I can improve on (ie making sure I am concise, avoiding verbal fillers such as ""ums"", etc). Bullock is super laid–back and chill as well."
comm,comm_st,102,spring,Sarah Idzik,5.55,5.42,4.83,4.33,5.27,3.00,"I'm a comms major and required to take this class but I wanted to use it as an opportunity to learn from the people around me and the stories they have to share, which definitely happened."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is very enjoyable. It is a low–stakes environment to improve your public speaking. Only 3 big speeches and the class is always enjoyable to attend.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Idzik is honestly amazing! She's leaving NU this year, so this CTEC won't be very helpful to future students, but overall she was just a great instructor and she clearly really cared about our success."
,,,,,,,,,,,Not well taught. Idzik isn't a good teacher. The class was disorganized and she made it very difficult. Most people I spoke to in the class thought she was a bad teacher.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Public speaking is a really good skill to have, and this course let me get more exposed to it and let me practice to be less nervous."
,,,,,,,,,,,I felt this was a course that helped me practice my public speaking skills and I liked how we honed down on what specifically we could improve on.
,,,,,,,,,,,Fun and chill class. Depends on the instructor though.
comm,comm_st,159,spring,Julia Barnett,6.00,5.33,5.67,4.67,6.00,3.00,A great course! I learned so much and loved how it was structured! Each week we were able to dive into a new and exciting topic! I wish there was more time because it was so great!
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was great –– a stress–free way to learn about the various aspects of computing. Each class featured a different topic and a different lecturer, and it was fascinating seeing how each of the pieces fit together."
comm,comm_st,201,fall,Thomas Billard,5.75,5.08,5.33,5.17,5.67,4.00,"Before taking the class I thought I already knew a lot about research methods and only took this class because I needed a 200–level class for my major, but I ended up learning so much more about how to PROPERLY set up a research experiment and use the research methods we learned. The class is very well–organized/structured, there are 6 assignments and you can revise them throughout the quarter. Each week had two classes, the first was a lecture to go over the material and the second was an in–class activity. Very helpful for solidifying understanding of the material. If you have any interest in qualitative/social sciences research, definitely take this class and try to take it as early as possible!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The professor was great, course was informative, and work was relatively light."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course gave me a good overview of the research methods in communications research, and was very interesting. Each week we went over one research method, which helped me learn them thoroughly. The first half to he class doesn't have any homework, and picks up in the latter half."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The first few weeks were very light, but once you started writing papers every week it gets kind of annoying"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course provided a very good overview of the main research methods in communication studies. If you're thinking of engaging with research in any filed of social science but you don't have any knowledge on research, the course is great for you."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really great course! Prof Billard is an engaging and fun professor. It's clear that they genuinely valued our education, as seen by how they kept their lectures interesting and took the time to describe topics' relevance in our lives. Honestly, really great class that I would recommend taking for the comm major, as Billard is just a cool prof in general. The essays are straightforward and prof tells you exactly what they want. 10/10 course despite the fact that it was a 9:30am"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Interesting class overall, Prof makes the content engaging & homework is very manageable and revisions (as many as you want) are allowed. First class of the week is just pure lecture, but second class of the week is usually hands–on discussion time which is helpful and sometimes pretty fun."
,,,,,,,,,,,"very organzied, helpful for my studies moving forward"
comm,comm_st,205,fall,Bruce Lambert,4.68,4.15,4.85,4.69,4.46,5.45,The grading system is based on an average of 3 grades. No attendance was required.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Interesting class, not very time consuming, and professor Lambert is very passionate about the topic. The class isn't an easy A and it will take studying and effort. There's no assignments just 3 exams, 2 multiple choice exams, and one take him essay exam. There's study guides you are encouraged to complete each week because they'll help you for the exam. The exams are very detailed and not easy, but all the information that's on the study guides is what will be on the tests, so they're fair. Again, do not take if you're just looking for an easy A."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Exams are very difficult, make sure to take good notes and study after every lecture. Don’t leave it until before the exam date"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great intro course, can be tricky but text book and study guides are always helpful when trying to understand ideas."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Lambert was a great lecturer, which definitely made the materials more intriguing to assimilate. The course contents were pretty straightforward –– basically so long as you do the study guide, you won't struggle with exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There is no readings or required work other than two midterm exams and a final exam. Other than that, all you really have to do is go to lectures. However, the exams are really difficult, detailed, and try to trick you. So, this isn't an easy course. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course if you don't have to take it, just becuase the format of three, really difficult exams making up your entire grade can be frustrating. However, if you do have to take this course, if you go to lectures, do the study guides, and really get to know the materials, you will be fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,this class was for sure the hardest comm class ive ever taken. you need to study like so so much. i did the study guides after every single class becuase that was the best chance for me to absorb material as class was taught. i had to study so so much and I also used the textbook to reinforce and learn material. you have gotta goto class and take as best of notes as possible and seriously start studying right away and then you will actually be fine but if you do not study till the last minute you will seriously fail so bad
,,,,,,,,,,,"Let me persuade you not to take this course. This was the worst class I have taken at Northwestern. As someone interested in persuasion broadly and within the business/marketing field, I am shocked that I had a nightmare of an experience in this class. Let's get into it: The instructor: Professor Lambert had little interest in teaching this class. Theories of Persuasion had been taught by the same professor for years, but that professor retired over the summer. So, the department needed someone to fill in for the retired professor, but they might as well have just canceled the course all together. Lambert used the previous professor's study guides, textbook, and past exams/materials (to my knowledge). Professor Lambert, who had previously been teaching graduate students, clearly did not want to be spending his time teaching undergraduates. He did not care for his students and rejected any feedback about the course. He dismissed our requests to add more practice questions to help us prepare for exams (we received 3 practice questions all quarter for the exams), give our exams back after posting results (making it impossible to learn from our mistakes and improve), include additional assignments/extra credit to demonstrate learning in ways other than the exams, or provide a general rubric for our final exam papers because that would “give away the answer” even though the responses were original and the prompts intentionally open–ended to allow students to show understanding. Additionally, the professor rushed through and skipped concepts that were essential to know for exams, without offering any other ways to learn the information. That said, he was generally accessible despite having “by appointment” office hours. Lambert also used examples in lecture and often tried to engage the class by asking questions to try to help teach the concepts more effectively, but most of the examples were taken from the textbook that really runs this course. Professors often can be the make or break factor for a class and, in this case, I attribute a large amount of the blame to the instructor. On the other hand, the entire course setup needs an overhaul (as I’ll explain below), so maybe even the most dedicated/talented professor couldn’t have saved this course. TAs: I can’t blame the TAs for much of my experience in this class. However, they repeatedly were forced to provide new information during discussion sections (which is not the point of discussion sections, as they are meant to review material from lectures). As a result, TAs and students alike were left with poor communication from the professor regarding course content and class organization (such as which concepts would be tested on exams, an issue that took 2 weeks to resolve). The lack of communication from the professor down to the TAs and students added more handicaps to an already dysfunctional class. Additionally, TAs made it clear during TA sections that the professor had little interest in working with graduate students and that he was extremely disorganized behind the scenes as well. The class setup: 3 exams worth 100% of the total grade. Of the 6 Communication Studies courses I have taken so far, this is the only course that relied so heavily on exams. Not to mention, the 2 midterm exams were multiple choice, nit–picky and were based on sheer rote memorization of convoluted theories that were not well explained during lecture. The only ways to do well on midterm exams were to either guess on a third of the questions or buy the book, which was said to be optional, supplementary material. In fact, after the first exam the professor asked the class, “How did anyone get this question right?! I didn’t even talk about it in class! Was it in the book?” Regarding the second midterm, he said “most people got this one question wrong – and I did, too when I took the exam myself!” The exams were a guessing game. The first midterm in particular was unfair, as the average raw score was 69%. While the exam had a strong curve (a 65% was curved to a B), no other Communication Studies course I’ve taken or heard of utilizes this evaluation system that is in place to rectify the poor teaching in this class. Clearly, something needs to change if studious Northwestern students are on average getting a raw score of a D on the exams. Our second midterm exam took place the Monday of reading week – one week before our final exam was due. This is poor planning and shows a lack of respect towards students. Regardless, the final exam consisted of 2 separate 4 page papers that responded to a choice of 6 prompts. We had just about a week to work on them with little guidance (no rubric as I mentioned above), but this was certainly a heavy workload with a midterm exam and 2 papers due within the span of a week when all of my other classes also had finals. Additionally, the TAs mentioned that the grading rubric for the papers were extremely nuanced (more than 20 pages), so the lack of transparency regarding the expectations for the assignment made it difficult for students to prepare their arguments well. Suggestions: I really hope someone in the Communication Studies department is reading this. It’s kind of insane to be writing 1200 words about this course, but I feel that my experiences can be used to positively shape future versions of this class. To that point, it would be a waste if I did not offer any suggestions to the many issues I’ve shared. First, this class should offer more flexibility in terms of the assignments throughout the quarter. Instead of memorizing theories from a book, we should be applying these theories in papers, projects, debates, presentations and more. Students should make their own political/advertising campaigns using the class concepts to apply such theoretical concepts to very real situations. Students should analyze current persuasion efforts and note what persuaders do well and where they might consider changing their ways based on the content from class. This gets students thinking – not guessing – about the solutions to persuasion problems. I also think this class would benefit from using materials other than the dry textbook. There are so many interesting articles and academic papers about persuasion that we didn’t get to discuss, so I feel that the most interesting aspects of persuasion were never actually discussed. The way this class is currently run misses the mark in content, structure, organization, and teaching. I hope these suggestions and others make this class what I’m sure it can become. Overall: do not take this class unless you absolutely need to. If you are not majoring in SoC, you should avoid this class because you will put in way more than you get out and be frustrated the whole time. If you are majoring in SoC (or this class is required for one of your academic programs), see if your advisor can substitute an elective for this core class. Northwestern needs to make big changes to this class but, until they do, do yourself a favor and stay away from this course. Take anything over this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It is very easy to do well in this class, but if you don't take the steps to do well you will do very poorly. The professor makes it excessively clear from literally the first day of class that you must go to class, and you MUST do the study guides. The exams come ENTIRELY from the study guides. Yes they're optional, and yes they're long, but they are the single thing that prepares you for the exam. I did all the study guides diligently, and personally I found the exams to be extremely easy and straightforward. My friends who did not do the study guides really struggled. I also suggest reading the textbook, it really helped me learn the topics the class moves at a very fast pace."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, this class was really engaging and the content was very interesting. As long as you do the study guides (answers to those will come from the textbook) and basically memorize everything on there, the two exams will be fine. The questions can be a bit tricky, but because the questions are pretty similar to those on the study guide, memorization will be your best friend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was HARD. As someone who's not the best test–taker, this class was really challenging as the only grading came from two exams and the final take–home exam. This class was also super fast paced, so it felt like we blew by certain theories. Additionally, no matter how long I studied for (which was multiple hours for each exam), the test questions felt designed to trick you despite coming from the study guides. I wish I did better in this class for the amount of work I put in. It had the potential to be fun and interesting, but ended up being one of my biggest stressors this quarter. Half the class dropped after the first exam, but I had to stay in this class as it was a pre–req for the IMC certificate."
,,,,,,,,,,,"They aren't lying when previous CTEC responders say to do the study guides. DO THEM. This class is not bad at all, in terms of difficulty, if you do the study guides for each lecture after class/weekly. Through the quarter, this will help you reinforce the material and slowly practice it for exams (which are very application based). There is a small curve, depending on how everyone does but don't rely on it. Pace yourself out, come to class, and do the study guides – you'll be fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought this was an interesting course for a major requirement. Honestly found the class material to be interesting and the information has stuck with me. Class is two 40 question multiple choice exams and a take home final with 2/6 essay questions needing to be answered. However, since the overall grade only consists of 3 components, it is ESSENTIAL that you use the study guides for studying. Also using the optional textbook is helpful. He takes his information straight from the textbook and puts that in the exams. But the exams are difficult and he admits it, so study the questions he provides. Prof Lambert is a great professor though!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Tough class. Really have to know your stuff.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is very manageable if you know (and do) what is expected of you. If you go to class, complete the study guides thoroughly, read the textbook when you're lacking complete notes, and ask all the questions you have, you will not only do fine... you will do very well. However, slacking off won't fly in this course. Your grade will definitely suffer if you don't put in the work that is necessary."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I took this class for an IMC prereq and it was the biggest pain. Because your only grades are from 2 exams and a final, the course requires you to put in so much time studying the very detailed and hefty load of material. Professor Lambert was little disorganized and sometimes what he said didn't overlap, and even conflicted with, what was in the textbook/study guides. The exams were very difficult and detailed for no reason. The second exam also fell the monday after Thanksgiving, which meant I had to spread break studying...I also thought sections were a waste of time to be honest (mine was with Yixue). I took this course to fulfill a prereq and that's why I stuck with it, but I would not recommend otherwise."
,,,,,,,,,,,Pretty easy if you do the textbook readings. Midterm questions come word–for–word from the textbook.
,,,,,,,,,,,I really liked this course. If you just go to class and do the study guides you will do well. I read the textbook sometimes but I didn't find it to be extra helpful. It was fun and the classroom was fun when people participated
,,,,,,,,,,,The class is the book
comm,comm_st,215,winter,Angela Ray,5.78,5.33,5.11,4.83,5.72,5.67,The grading in this class is really annoying the way that the breakdowns are it’s really hard to get a B+ and there’s no rounding at all
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class will teach you a lot, but it is very challenging. No one grading is an ""easy"" grader. Angela and Ashley want to ensure you understand all concepts and reflect that in your essays. That said, if you go to class, participate/pay attention, take decent notes, and spend a lot of time on your essay, you will be fine. Angela is a great professor and very qualified. Her writings are well done, and she curates an open space for class conversations. It may not be the easiest A you will take at NU, but it is worth it."
,,,,,,,,,,,I think that this course was helpful for understanding the concepts of rhetorical discourse. I would say that the grading was pretty harsh although the amount of assignments was fine.
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this course and I LOVED Professor Ray. I went into the quarter feeling skeptical and I was so pleasantly surprised. The course is well structured and there is support for students where needed. Would highly recommend taking this with Ray if you have the option.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr Ray is the best. she is so smart and such a good professor and son nice. I took this class as a requirement but it really did help me thinking critically and persuasively. the class can be boring sometimes, but overall thought the material was really important and the time in class usually flew by."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a tough class. Readings are VERY dense, and there is a lot of work (3 large papers, a small paper, final exam). It isn't super hard to do well, but you do HAVE to go to class and put time into the assignments. I personally was not interested in this topic and found the class to be quite boring. But Ray is a great teacher and good lecturer so it was pretty good as far as major classes go."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Ray is so kind and cares so much about her students. She's also flexible with conflicts, which meant a lot to me as I had a difficult quarter. This class definitely opens your eyes to a variety of political issues and how rhetorical analysis deepens your understanding of those conflicts. I've also never written rhetorical analyses and this class was a great introduction to that—Professor Ray is so extremely knowledgeable in this field, and her feedback was very valuable and helped my writing a lot throughout the quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really, really enjoyed this class. It helped me learn how to structure my own rhetoric and analyze other texts. The professor was AMAZING and the TA was very thoughtful and kind. A wonderful introduction to rhetorical studies and practice."
,,,,,,,,,,,The course focuses on theories of rhetorical criticism and has a variety of readings on rhetorical criticism. The course spends time explaining techniques used within rhetorical criticism and also discusses the course readings and how these techniques were applied. On the paper assignments students apply their knowledge from lecture to pieces of rhetoric.
,,,,,,,,,,,The readings were engaging and were well suited to the course because we were able to think and write about them in many different ways which created a lot of good discussion.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class ended up being more enjoyable than I initially thought. Yes there are readings for each class but the readings are honestly either short or an interesting read, and I’m not a reader. There’s 3 papers throughout the quarter, a short reflection paper and final exam. Attendance is also mandatory. If you go to every class and do the readings the final exam will be fine and she also gives a study guide that’s helpful. The class is challenging but you need to want to put in the work to get something rewarding out of it. Dr Ray is an amazing professor and I recommend always going to her office hours as she’s very helpful."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Ray does an incredible job making a class about rhetoric and persuasive theory super engaging and interesting. I really like that each class was structured in a similar way (mini lecture + class discussion on assigned reading). The class flowed very nicely, and by the end of the quarter, I felt like I had a deeper understanding of rhetorical analysis and the way these skills can be applied to everyday life."
comm,comm_st,225,spring,Claudio Benzecry,5.38,5.11,4.83,4.66,5.26,3.89,"Take this course!! Claudio is a great professor, he is so nice and always weaves in his personal examples that are very relatable especially for international students, making it less US–centric and more inclusive as a class. There are 4 reading memos, an op–ed, a midterm exam and a final group project which is extremely manageable. There are also readings for every class which are quite interesting but some are dense. This is a great class to take, you learn about concepts such as the Self, Orientalism, Algorithms and more."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a requirement for Comm studies and it was everything I wanted from a required class. It was low time commitment, was very easy (average on the midterm was like a 97%), and is super laid back. Prof. Benzecry is great and engaging. This class will teach you some interesting ideas and is super flexible. Very chill"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would definitely recommend taking this course for the comm studies major requirement. Claudio is a good guy and the class content is pretty interesting. Midterm was not hard, we had a review session before where he highlighted important stuff, I would recommend taking good notes in class and then just review those in addition to some of the readings beforehand. Memos were fine, and the OpEd assignment was fun. Final project is also great, especially if you had a good group like I did. Overall, good class with stimulating content!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Had to take this course. I think it’s definitely one of the better required courses. You have a midterm and a final project with 4 memos throughout the quarter. The professor made it more interesting
,,,,,,,,,,,"class was pretty heavy discussion based – readings weren't that difficult, neither were the assignments. class wasn't exactly my favorite but prof was passionate and it was not bad at all"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is great — you get an understanding of the academic canon surrounding the topics of communication and culture, but it's not too much work. Four reading memos, a midterm, an op–ed, a project, and class participation are all we are graded on in the end. It's a great spring quarter class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class. Four memos (150 words), one longer Op–ed (500 words), one midterm that was super easy, and a final group project. Class attendance is not required but he counts class participation and he only gives a good grade for that if he remembers your name so talk in class because if you raise your hand and he knows your name you are in a good spot."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The workload is very manageable — there are 4 memos (reading responses), a writing task, a midterm, and a final project. The class material itself is pretty interesting too."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is not to much work and teacher is very good. I enjoyed this class because it is interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you are looking for a 200–level major requirement, this is definitely a good choice. The course description is a little vague but the content is actually super interesting and, in the second half of the course, very relevant. There are four ""memos"" throughout the quarter where you reflect on different readings. There is also an op–ed assignment and a midterm. Lastly, there is a final group project. The assignments are very manageable and if you follow the guidelines, you'll be fine. Professor Benzecry is very entertaining and willing to help students, but definitely take advantage of your TAs! I'd recommend this course!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is an Easy A, take it!! The assignments are graded nicely, and you get to do a creative project for your final. The midterm is easy as long as you study for it. Participation is part of your grade too, so make sure they know your name. The professor can be snarky sometimes"
,,,,,,,,,,,The grading was fair.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course! Theres a lot of in–class discussions which are super interesting. You also have to write four short reading summaries for the whole quarter, but thats pretty easy. The midterm exam has very predictable questions so as long as you take notes and know the readings you'll do well. I also liked the final group project where you had to write a paper/record a podcast/etc. to summarize the viewpoints of 3 authors in the course. Claudio is an amazing instructor and I really recommend taking this class with him!"
,,,,,,,,,,,good class. easy major credit. professor has a fun accent.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was more interesting and theoretical than I expected. The readings were interesting and the professor is engaging. However, he doesn't post the slides which was a con for me because I had to prioritize writing things down rather than listening. There are 4 memos (short reading responses), one op–ed (longer reading response), a midterm, and a final project. The final project is kind of open–ended and you can kinda do whatever you want (within reason of course). Overall it is a pretty easy but interesting class, would recommend it."
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved the discussion aspect of this course. The professor was amazing and helped me learn a lot.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class! I think that it was extremely interesting and thought provoking. Claudio's mix of lecture and discussion is great. I thought there was going to be a larger discussion of modern culture, but the main topics of the class are more so about the development of culture and the role communication/people had in it. However, it is easy to relate the concepts to modern culture."
,,,,,,,,,,,Fun and easy class that stimulated many interesting conversations– I loved a lot of the readings we were assigned as well
,,,,,,,,,,,This is not a difficult course. I liked the topics that were discussed but I feel like the structure of the course doesn't facilitate a lot of engagement with the material.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Did not enjoy this class. Readings and lectures were boring and I don't think I came out of the class having learned anything at all. Literally was just getting through the course because it was a requirement for comms major. If you don't have to take it, I would not recommend. Honestly didn't struggle getting an A at all and assignments were very reasonable but I think you could find other comms courses that are an easy A requirement but are actually interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course and found the material to be more engaging than I was expecting. Professor Benzecry did a great job of breaking down the readings and explaining them in simple, digestable terms. Overall, I found the course to be very interesting and would definitely recommend it for students who are interested in the way communication impacts society and the role it plays in our culture."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved the cultural aspects, the tec. was interesting especially when talking about A.I. but culture was my favorite."
comm,comm_st,227,fall,Jeremy Birnholtz,5.33,4.98,4.90,4.80,5.03,6.00,"This class was not only interesting, but extremely relevant to my life. Prof. Birnholtz warned us that we wouldn’t be able to shut up about the class once we learned the content, and he was so right. I can’t say that any other course at NU has had me saying, “Actually, we were just talking about that in my Comm&Tech class the other day…” as much as this one. I highly, highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not my favorite course... The topic sounds amazing and I did enjoy a lot of the material, but there was more work than there needed to be. The class is split into 3 sections, and each section you have 2–3 assignments and a midterm at the end. The Prof and TA graded fairly harshly, and while the set up of the course is ""choose your own adventure"" based on the time of assignments you want to do I ended up being confused about when and which assignments I had to do. It'd be a lot clearer if there were just assigned tasks rather than selecting 2–3 out of 5 possible homework assignments. The midterms weren't overly difficult, but also not an easy A. This was my first 200 level Communication Studies course, and I can confidently say that it is more work I've had in the department (compared to 5 other 300 level courses). Expect a fair time commitment and that you will probably end up dreading this class by the end. Also, we had to do tweets before each class about the reading which were kind of a nuisance to remember."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would say the workload is heavier than expected. If you want to get 9.5 and above on your blog assignment, you would probably spend the whole weekend writing and revising. It's really hard to fully explain the concepts and incorporate appropriate details without exceeding the 400 words limit. Also, the exam is pretty hard and tight, you have to complete 40 mc and two essays (each 250 words) in 80 minutes, which means you have to learn the concept very well. It's reasonable to get A– but hard to get a solid A."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course covers the concept of communications and technology through various readings on a selection of different topics. The course has exams and a variety of different types of assignments to be completed for the topics of each exam. The lectures often covered complex topics from readings and were engaging by encouraging participation and application through various in class activities.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I will definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in the link between communication and tech. The course is divided into three sections, covering everyday design, human interactions, algorithms, privacy...pretty much everyone could find something interesting in comm227. Exams are carried out at the end of each of the sections (no final exam, yay!), which are not very difficult if you spend time going through all the class concepts. The assignments, though, were quite challenging for me cuz the grading was weird. I would recommend going to the undiscussions instead of writing blogs. Classes are fun, and Prof. Birnholtz is super passionate about class topics, and his creativity is impressive. Overall I recommend this class"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is in general a great comm class. Jeremey is brilliant and has a lot of wisdom to share. It is a little more difficult than the average 200–level communications class but it is not terribly difficult to get a good grade. But, some things are graded unnecessarily hard. I think the average final grade for my class was 92 so pretty good. The class is a little confusing in the beginning because there are a lot of different components, but basically, it is a few small papers/projects and three exams. In general, I would definitely recommend this class, the content is super interesting! Totally manageable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely take this course with Jeremey! He is an amazing teacher who is so passionate and engaging. I feel like I learned so much throughout the course and it kept me interested. These concepts we learn are really relevant to the things we use everyday, social media and technology, algorithms and more. There are three noncumulative exams and other assignments which are a great way to earn a lot of points. Grading is extremely fair. The teacher and TA's are super helpful with any question you have. Some of the readings are quite dense and complicated but it is interesting. I really enjoyed this class overall!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Birnholtz is amazing and this class is super interesting. We focus on three different topics and it never becomes boring or moves too fast. 100% recommend taking.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I didn't realize the different aspects to this subject, and I found it very interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"this class was a super interesting class that challenged me a lot more than i originally thought it would. comm and tech offers so much insight into concepts i've never thought about in not just social media, but the intersection between technology and how it plays into factors that impact our interactions/communication with the rest of society. jeremy is a great instructor and he clearly has so much passion when he's lecturing. it's a stimulating class, but you definitely have to work hard to get an A. i felt like the grading was a bit harsh at times, especially with blog posts, but the exams are fair and they definitely require a good understanding of the material if you want to do well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Jeremy and co. are great, I'm a big fan of his teaching/lecturing style and the content of the course is supremely interesting. Some of the concepts are really slippery, to the point where I question the actual need to get that nitty gritty about some of it (there are concepts that are vaguely indistinguishable from each other but you will probably get asked about the difference. A common feedback will be not to overthink it, which is a bit unhelpful when thinking about it even for a second yields sizeable overlaps). The menu assignments are confusing at first but easy to get the hang of (but they need to up the word limit, they often ask for more response than can reasonably fit into 400 words). The only bad experience I had was with the ""undiscussion"" where the way the questions were constructed was really frustrating. Overall, it's a good class, not an unreasonable amount of work and interesting content that's taught well."
,,,,,,,,,,,Loved this class! Professor Birnholtz teaches very well and has great content to keep people engaged.
,,,,,,,,,,,I LOVED this class. Jeremy is amazing and the lectures are always engaging. Would HIGHLY recommend.
,,,,,,,,,,,"really loved the course content itself, super fun to see how everything tied in together and how it related to our everyday interactions with technology! sometimes things felt a little bit jargon–y but it overall i found this class to be extremely rewarding."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It teaches various aspects of how technology affects communication, and I learned especially a lot from the ""mini–lectures"" that were a part of every class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was generally good with some hiccups. The way the class is run can be confusing at first, but the course is set up to provide students flexibility. The course is divided into 3 parts (each part lasts about 3 weeks). For each part, you are required to complete 2 project/short essay assignments and one exam. There are nightly readings (for the first part they are important to do, but they become less important as the course goes on) and tweets on Twitter responding to the reading of the day. Jeremy is a knowledgable professor and is generally approachable. The main issue with the course is that the content can be dry and differences in concepts are pretty nit–picky. His exams are generally fair (averages in the mid to high 80s). Jeremy gives you chances to post questions that can actually appear on the exam, though, so there are ways to prepare for the exams. Grading is mostly fair but, again, can be quite frustrating. They are very strict with word counts and fine details that, in most classes, do not impact the grading very much. So while this class was neither great nor bad, I would say it's a decent course to take. Not difficult to do well in but pretty hard to do exceptionally in. Overall would recommend but not my favorite Comm course."
,,,,,,,,,,,Class was okay! The readings are a lot and the exam questions are very wordy and could have two answers. Blog assignments graded very harshly(felt like i couldn’t win) as well as other menu assignments!
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this class! Jeremy and the TA's do a great job at clearly explaining the material. The readings were super interesting and the course material overall made me approach life in a different way. If you are confused Jeremy always explains and helps. I highly recommend this class!
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVED THIS COURSE! As a McCormick student who took this as their only non–STEM class for the quarter, it was refreshing coming in twice a week to participate in the lecture about really cool topics on communication and technology, including design and how we use technology in our relationships. JEREMY IS AMAZING – he truly is a master in his and is really friendly, being sure to always call all 50+ of us by our names in class. The readings – albeit long – are really interesting and you can honestly understand most of the content from the readings just by coming to lecture and paying attention."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Exams were a piece of cake if you paid attention in lecture and/or skimmed the readings, and the menu assignments really give you the freedom to do whatever is easiest (honestly just do the blogs and maybe an Undiscussion or two to get the advantage of getting your lowest grade dropped)."
,,,,,,,,,,,I can never look at a poorly designed door the same way after this class!
,,,,,,,,,,,"What made this class terrible was that the exams tested you on material that was common sense worded difficultly. In other words, the exams were hard to get a good grade on for no reason. Also, the blog assignments are graded very harshly. Overall, not a class to take if you want a good grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,The professor and TAs made it very difficult to really do well in this course. The grading is very harsh and rude at times. I thought the professor was very enthusiastic and prepared for every class; he clearly has been doing this a long time. It is quite a bit of work and very confusing topics.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was one of my favorite classes I have taken. I am obsessed with Jeremy's teaching style, he is so engaging and a literal genius."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought I would learn a lot about social media and marketing–related topics, but this course was more about design and psychology. It was still enjoyable, though, and I learned a lot. The work in this course was also a little bit more than expected."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course definitely requires effort if you want an A.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The topics are interesting and provide a lot of new insight into modern internet technology and online interactions. Jeremy is really nice and is always willing to answer questions during office hours. There is a substantial amount of reading and homework, but it's manageable for the most part."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is actually my FAVORITE course so far at Northwestern!! It's incredible how many concepts are relevant (I'm also a CS major, haha) and intellectually inspiring. There're sometimes guest lectures where Jeremy brings in amazing people for sharing!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I felt that the structure of this course was kind of confusing, and while I appreciate the ability to more or less build your own assignment schedule, it was kind of confusing"
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you have the chance to take this class, do it. The subject matter is really interesting and Prof. Birnholtz is great."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is so interesting, Professor Birnholtz is great, and the content isn't super hard to understand – though there are definitely times you need to go to office hours. The MENU assignments, 2 for each of the three units, can be a bit tough but if you do the right ones they are not bad and actually interesting. Go to all of the Undiscussions, these two hour projects that count as a MENU assignment."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would recommend taking this as a comm studies requirement out of the other options. The content is not super structured but it is definitely interesting. The TAs and Jeremy were super helpful and fun to listen to. Grades consist of three exams (MC and short answer), 6 menu assignments (two per each section of the class – sounds confusing but you basically just pick between options like writing a blog post, going to a discussion section, etc). You have to tweet before every class. Also participation – just go to class and you will write your name on an activity sheet that always gets handed in. There are a bunch of extra ways to increase participation. Overall an interesting course would recommend!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was a positive, mentally stimulating experience that marked a bright side to the quarter"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Relatively easy concepts that are actually applicable/useful for comms–related tech positions. assignments were reasonable in both volume and cadence, and I liked the fun menu structure of assignments that gave you flexibility to find where you could do best."
comm,comm_st,246,winter,Kimberly Pusateri,5.00,4.85,4.67,3.85,4.46,3.31,"Great class, great professor, however, the three hours could be tiring"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good as a minor elective, would definitely take again. Also good for looking at future careers I am very interested in"
,,,,,,,,,,,"i loved this class. the prof is really nice, and i liked how we had guest speakers every week. the assignments were helpful in further teaching you the info. the final presentation was also very unique because i have not had a class require you to interview someone, so that was fun."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is an easy A. It is a lot of busy work that you have to do in order to get an A. There are extremely clear guidelines on how to do the work. If you do it according to those guidelines, you will get an A. But this class is very boring and lectures feel very, very long."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was great and not difficult at all. Weekly discussion post based on a reading and/or video, rejection papers, small personal project, and one final group project."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Highly recommend this course. The professor is AWESOME. One of the best I have had here. Super understanding, great speaker, very engaged with her students. The course material is also extremely relevant if you are interested in healthcare, even if you aren't focused on communication. Light course load, chill grading, no tests. Also we had like 6 speakers come in who were in various positions in the healthcare space which were great."
,,,,,,,,,,,"While the class is easy and not a lot of work, she treats the students as if they were 7 years old. 3–hour class that could be hour 20 easily."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course as an opportunity to see what comm classes are like at northwestern. I do think the professor graded fairly hard on weekly assignments, but that just pushes you to do your best work each week. I would take this again. Very interesting and offers concepts people don’t normally think about related to the health field."
comm,comm_st,274,fall,Aymar Jean,5.52,5.24,4.90,4.29,5.52,3.38,"I really enjoyed this class. I was scared of it at first, but I really loved the discussions we had in class and the topics that we touch on. I really think that the professor is a great lecturer and keeps you engaged for all three hours of class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Interesting and easy class. The topics, readings, and films were very cool and there's only 3 real assignments –– a video essay, essay proposal, and essay. Pretty fun and easy!"
,,,,,,,,,,,it was super relevant to life and it was connected with apps that we use everyday and we and so much freedom
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved learning about the many dimensions of the entertainment industry, but I wish we had more examples in class and more small discussions because the class was so big"
,,,,,,,,,,,Lots of fun and interesting conversations during class time. But it's a pretty elementary overview of the entertainment industry and mostly information that could be found from a few hours on the internet. The screenings during class were also unnecessary. Would rather have just watched the content at home and talked more in class.
,,,,,,,,,,,All of the class interactive discussions and the shows/movies helped me learn a lot.
,,,,,,,,,,,You NEED to take this course! It is super interesting and you will learn SO much about all aspects of entertainment. Dr. C is the best and is has super interesting lectures and homework assignments. Every class felt relevant to todays world. Couldn't recommend this class enough!!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, the course is pretty interesting and does not have a lot of time commitment. The course really isn't that hard and Dr. Christian is a great professor trying to keep you engaged. Because it is a long class, it can be boring at times, but it goes by fast with movies and shows in the last hour"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures in class were really interesting. Often, the material discussed in class was connected to real–world events of real–life entertainers which fit the topic we were discussing. Considering this, it was quite nice to be to apply the material we were covering in class to the real world. The work in this class was definitely reasonable. There were weekly discussion posts, a midterm abstract, a project, and a final paper. The instructor was willing to answer any questions. Discussions in class were really interesting. Largely due to the thought–provoking questions asked in class which really made me think about the contemporary entertainment industry and figures within it."
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a perfectly fine course and I like professor Christian as a teacher but I did not find that I learned that much. The readings were often really dense and esoteric academic pieces that were not helpful in understanding the industries we looked at. The lectures were better but I still found them a little too conceptual and not as focused on the nitty gritty of how things work as I would have liked. That being said it was not much work and I found professor Christian to be an engaging teacher.
comm,comm_st,295,fall,Moya Bailey,5.92,5.69,5.46,5.38,5.77,4.85,I really enjoyed all of the collaborative aspects of this course. We always discussed with small groups or short story partners which is a really helpful way to get feedback. Dr. B is very open to feedback from students as well which makes it a very flexible and accomodating environment.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course. The main goal of this course was to learn about the genre of Afrofuturism and write a related short story by the end. All of the literature we read was relevant, interesting, and so helpful in finding inspiration for my own short story, as well as just teaching me more about feminist literature and issues. There was a lot of reading but it was always a fun time. The discussions were interesting and chill. It was a very fun course to take and my favorite this quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I highly recommend taking a class with Dr. Bailey. She really meets us where we are at (both academically and socially). She is very cognizant of the workload she gives students and gives us time to explore the concepts in depth. There was a decent amount of reading, but all of the texts were digestible and made you want to read more. I've never been in a class that captivated me to read past the assigned bounds for a given discussion day. Dr. Bailey's feedback on assignments was also very helpful and structured how I approached future assignments. The class is pretty relaxed. It's really what you make out of it and how much you contribute. I enjoyed exploring afro–futurism and having the time to read Octavia Butler's work along with other academic articles that explore this type of scholarship. I feel like any class Dr. Bailey will teach is going to be one that Northwestern really needs, so I really recommend putting any of her classes on your list because they will really open you up to a whole new field of thought!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Please take this course if you can. Dr. Bailey is a phenomenal professor. There are so many different aspects as to why I loved this course; from its usage of alternative course structure —assignments being a short story and a presentation, instead of say essays or tests — as well as the flexible timelines for the blog posts; to the content, which was a comprehensive introduction to Octavia Butler, speculative fiction, legacies of Black/queer futurisms, etc. I am leaving this class with much learned and much to consider. Grading isn't something to worry about in this class, as you can tell this class is designed for you to actually learn, to engage and to reflect."
,,,,,,,,,,,This was an amazing course and Prof. Bailey made learning such an enjoyable and easy process. The course itself was interesting as we discussed ways in which we can envision the future and what the future looks like for different identities.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course. Dr. B is an amazing professor, lecturer, and mentor. She is available to assist you one–on–one, and build a relationship with you if that is something you desire. She is a pocket of joy in the School of Communications, and an island of hope when I felt lost at sea this quarter. I wish the School of Comm had more classes like this that I could have taken earlier as a Communication Studies major. Dr. B's work, in and outside of the classroom is truly excellent and inspiring for students to come."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Bailey is an absolute pleasure. I would take any class that she’s teaching even if I had no idea what it was about. Not only was she great at teaching material from a holistic and compassionate lens, but she also engaged with all of us, taking her time to get to know us and learn about our individual work. She is so willing to work through accommodations and obstacles because she doesn’t want you to just do work, she wants you to learn."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed the class readings and our discussions were low–pressure and relaxed. I like how this course challenged us to think creatively about current issues. It wasn't much work if you stayed on top of the discussion posts, and I generally enjoyed all of the work we did."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this class. I never thought I would find true bliss in learning at such a high level. I enjoyed the challenge and was motivated my Professor B to keep pushing myself. An important aspect to me was the safe learning space she created. Not only were we actively learning outside of the classroom, but inside the classroom, it felt as if we as a class were ascending to a higher level of understanding each other."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really appreciated the content selected for the course. The readings were engaging and it allowed me to get to know Octavia Butler's work more deeply. Dr. B also provided a classroom environment that was welcoming and allowed for open discussion. I loved getting to see what my classmates' came up with for their short stories too.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Having a clear syllabus with the different deadlines as well as being able to discuss with each other was extremely helpful. Additionally, everything in the syllabus was exactly how the course was set up, so I didn't have many moments of ""I don't know what I'm doing or what's due when"". This course also wasn't boring at all and each class I wanted to learn more on the subject and about my classmates' short stories. Lastly, this course did a lot for me because Dr. Bailey had one of the librarians come in and give us information on how to research for our research projects and short stories, so it wasn't daunting when I had to do that work outside the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The length of some readings did catch me off guard, but I still enjoyed reading the texts. It was also encouraging to read published work from other new writers."
comm,comm_st,295,winter,Moya Bailey,5.63,5.69,5.06,4.63,5.31,3.76,"I took this class solely out of curiosity and to learn without a heavy health science background. Dr. Bailey is great and eager to help you learn more and support your academic journey. I learned a lot and would highly recommend others take this class, especially because I feel like most other classes don't discuss healthcare issues with the nuance this class addresses."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Love the professors she keeps the class engaged. before signing up I was not interested in the class at all, but after time I found the class to be interesting. This class is easy, and it just consists of creating a podcast on the topics you learned through the class and writing two essays. She offers a lot of extra credit but overall its an easy A and at the same time it's an interesting class."
,,,,,,,,,,,An amazing class! Professor B is really great and the topics we study are very interesting. Final project is a podcast related to topics we've studied in class and a good experience to dive into a topic of interest. Would highly recommend!
,,,,,,,,,,,"this course is incredibly engaging, drawing from videos, online games, and a fiction novel as well as the informative journal articles typically seen in college courses. i appreciated the wide array of topics we covered and how they all connected to the central issue of black women's health outcomes and the social health determinants that affect black people as a whole. we dived into the sensitive topics in a thoughtful and well–paced way that allowed us to intimately engage with topics as well as articulate our responses and personal connections in a productive environment. professor bailey is a caring and thoughtful professor who cares deeply about these issues and her students. courseload is not heavy and the final project (a podcast) was very engagin, interesting, and fun! i highly recommend this course!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS! Dr. B is incredible. She teaches this class in such an engaging, caring, and insightful way. I had never taken a health–related class here at Northwestern before this one, and it truly sparked so much interest and made me determined to want to learn more. This course has NO exams, finals, etc. It's just two one–page papers and a podcast project. Super manageable and easy to understand the material in this class. I cannot express enough how much you should take this class whether you're interested in comms/health or not"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed learning from Dr. B. She knows a lot about the subject and has been published several times, this was clearly shows in the interest I gained from taking the class. Definitely recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As a person, Moya is really awesome!! I loved her energy. But as a professor, we didn't do much in the class. Instead of teaching, most of the time we would discuss the readings and watch videos. I didn't feel like I learned much from the class apart from the obvious: there is racism in medicine. This is a comm studies class, and we barely talked about methods of communication, wish there was more of a focus on thatI loved the gamified grading, which means that you basically can increase your grade in the class by completing more assingments. The final was a podcast which was super chill and easy. Overall, it is a fun and chill class to take if you are looking for something like that."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed taking this class. Dr. B is an awesome professor! The discussions are really interesting as well, and I liked the readings too. This class taught me to think and see things from a different perspective. There are no tests which I appreciated, and I liked how Dr. B emphasized multimedia learning (readings, discussions, videos, podcasts, etc). Overall I highly recommend this class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is pretty easy to get through and you learn a lot about the history of medicine and how it relates to Black Feminist health but also touch on a lot of current topics. The main project was recording a podcast which you work on throughout the quarter so it's not that time consuming. Would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in pursuing a career in medicine as it touches on a lot of important topics that aren't really taught in the regular pre–med track.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a very good course for learning about the history of the health industry and its relation to Black Women. It brought so many dimensions to the problem and was very reflective, I this course taught me a lot. I reccommend taking it for its educational aspect! Its also not a lot of work so a very non–time consuming class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great introductory survey of Black feminist health science studies and definitely a very easy course––grade is based off of class participation, two one–page reading reflections, and a final 6–10 minute podcast episode. If you have any background in studying American healthcare/SDoH, this class will likely not provide you with any new information, but it is interesting to think about from a communications studies perspective with regard to the language we use. I wish class had been more discussion–forward, though–– we typically would spend the majority of class extensively summarizing the assigned readings, which defeats the purpose of doing them at home, or watching a video together with a few discussion questions. This class could have benefitted from more small group discussion and more intellectually challenging material. Definitely a very accessible course for someone who has never before studied health sciences or health disparities, but given the fact that most students had some background in these areas, I wish that we had been able to go more in–depth. Dr. B is fantastic and super sweet, and the gamified grading in this course makes an A very achievable."
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved it. Dr. B is the best professor that I've had so far and I loved learning in this class. Readings weren't too long and we always talked about them in class in case you may have missed one. The book we read was also super interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was amazing! Dr. B is an incredible professor, and she teaches this course very well. The assignments are very low–key, and the podcast project was so much fun (you get to research whatever topic you want related to the course materials). Great stress–free class where I learned a ton, will definitely take another class with Dr. B in the future!"
comm,comm_st,295,spring,Larissa Buchholz,5.91,5.82,5.82,5.73,5.73,5.91,"Going in, I had no idea what to expect, since the title of the course (The Construction of Value in Cultural Markets) is a bit complex. Essentially, the course taught me about the contemporary art market and how value is created (ie. how artwork is priced) in such a non–traditional market atmosphere that isn't driven by traditional economic guidelines of ""supply and demand"". The course attempts to undercover the curiosities behind why some people spend millions of dollars on a single artwork, which has no practical value. To answer these questions, the course involved once–a–week lectures where the professor would explain some aspect of the art market. This could be the players involved, such as art critics, auction houses, and galleries, and how they establish value in the art market. Or this could be about the international development of art markets in different countries, for example comparing the development of Western contemporary art markets to Chinese contemporary art markets. Each week, we read assigned articles and research papers before class, which were used as the framework for the class lecture and discussion."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Although Professor Buchholz can seem intimidating at the start of the quarter, the workload of the class is actually very light (less than 3 hours per week). Also, the class only meets once per week. There are no midterms, and one final exam at the end of the quarter. (writing this before taking it so cannot speak to that) Each lecture is logically organized by first going over what students wrote in response to the weekly readings (discussion post) and then the professor ties that into the topic for the week."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, the class is very low–stress and an interesting introduction into the world of contemporary art markets, a subject quite baffling and complex from an outsider perspective. To make the most out of the class, I recommend reading the readings in detail because they are relevant to every class, and provide the foundation for the discussions."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Larissa is the best teacher I've had at Northwestern so far. She's so attentive to her students' wellbeing in and out of class. That being said, he class is 3–4 hours of reading outside of 3–hour lecture, so it is a time commitment. But she makes this very clear at the beginning of the course and emphasizes that she really wants students who are committed. Because of this, no task in class was too great. She always gave us reading memos to help us not waste time and was amazing at communicating when you had trouble. She's super encouraging and all around a lovely person to know and to learn from."
,,,,,,,,,,,"You do not need to know anything about art prior to starting the course. The readings can be a bit challenging but they are manageable. The professor is very knowledgable, engaging and understanding. Slides are posted on canvas and the content is well structured. Engage with the readings in the weekly discussion posts and during class time and it is easy to do well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS. IT IS AMAZING. LARISSA IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. She is so knowledgeable, the class is so fascinating. She runs it in the best way I've ever seen any professor do it. She basically has us do 2–3 readings a week for the one 3hour class meeting, then on Monday before Wednesday class she has us write 150–200 word response that connects the readings and asks us to write a question about them which we answer ourselves. It's the most engaging way to do the readings. We were all so prepared because of this method and that led to us having amazingly interesting discussions. Best class I've ever taken. Makes me want to be an art sociologist. Would take any class with her."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Initially, I was intimated by the course. However, the workload is extremely manageable and there is no busywork. Every bit of work I put into the course felt rewarding and I learned so much. It doesn't reflect other classes — there is only a weekly reading memo and a final exam. I really appreciated Prof. Buchholz's break from the norm. Also, the smaller class size was really nice because we all got to know each other."
,,,,,,,,,,,I love this course! It is very well structured. Professor cares about her students and makes sure that you form cohesive knowledge after taking the class. The workload is light and the materials are very interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was enjoyable since it was mostly discussion–based, and Professor Buchholz cares about her students and always seeks feedback from her students to improve her teaching and classes. This class has many readings, but it is somewhat manageable if your course load is not too difficult. Overall, I recommend this class if you are interested in art or art markets or just looking for another comm class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I did not know anything about the art market before taking this class, so I was hesitant about taking it. I am glad I took it because I learned so much about the art machine and the different dynamics that are at play with art valuation. Larissa is so passionate about the subject and really cares for her students. She was constantly asking for feedback and incorporating it. The readings can be dense but her reading guides help sort through them more easily."
comm,comm_st,303,winter,Nathan Walter,5.78,5.51,5.34,4.60,5.60,3.20,I like how Nathan would create scenarios and examples to help us learn because he created experiences related to the material so we would remember it better
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a fantastic amazing class. Nathan is a phenomenal lecturer and really makes class fun and engaging. Class is set up with blog posts weekly (you write one a quarter and all the other weeks you just do a reply) as well as a midterm and final project. The content was super interesting and applicable, final project was easy and midterm was fair. Would 100% recommend this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class and an incredible professor! Nathan's engaging, informative, and always there to help us out. I feel like I learned a lot about misinformation, especially from the historical angle of the tobacco industry. Really great class, but would have preferred to choose partners on group projects."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Nathan is one of my favorite professors at this school, and the content of this class is absolutely some of the most fascinating stuff I've had the chance to learn here. Cannot recommend this class highly enough, no notes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was clear that Nathan and Callie really cared about the students and wanted us to succeed. I liked that we learned about topics that are commonly riddled with misinformation and strategies to combat misinformation. The weekly discussion posts didn't really help me learn and felt more like busywork, but other than that I really enjoyed this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,The class is very straightforward. Nathan is very charismatic and makes the class very fun.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is by far my favorite Com class I've taken at Northwestern. Not also does Professor Walter come to class incredibly enthusiastic about the material, he engages the class through humor, and teaches his lectures in ways that allow the students to grasp and remember the content. The assignments are not time consuming, as the only exam (midterm) isn't hard if you study the right way. Definitely take this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was such an engaging and interesting course where I learned about the types of misinformation, and how it affects. This course is necessary, especially in this era of information overload and short messaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This the best class. Easy A, did barely any work :)"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Loved this class! Not too much work in terms of assignments, and there's a midterm which is fine as long as you consistently show up to and pay attention to lectures. The final project for us was a podcast assignment which ended up being really fun and a nice way to integrate course concepts to real–world examples. Prof. Walter is an effective and also funny lecturer, really appreciated all the work he and the TA put into making classtime entertaining. If you're interested broadly in misinformation, then it is the perfect introductory course. Take this class if you can!"
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved how fun and engaging the course was while being educational. I also liked there were many opportunities for group work in the class because it felt very collaborative!
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is interesting from a journalistic standpoint. Nothing stood out to me that made me love this class, it felt kind of silly at times."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Do NOT take this class if you don't like being graded based off three big assignments. There's a small partner assignment, written midterm, and group final project that they give no time to work on during class, and only provide their emails to help you reach them which is very inefficient. I would definitely go to lectures because the midterm is based off of them, the midterm is definitely fair and they are not trying to trick you which I appreciated."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class had one Midterm, which I studied a lot for and did not do great on so that was a bit tough, but mainly because it is a lot of memorization and really understanding the key theories. We did not have a final exam, though, just a group project that we had class time to meet with the groups and do which I greatly appreciated. I don't think we could have done the group project without that extra week of designated class time to get it done with everyone's conflicting schedules."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was amazing. I would 100% recommend taking this class. Dr. Walter is an entertaining lecturer and a really nice person. Class material was really interesting as well.
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was amazing and SO relevant to our current world. Nathan was an AMAZING teacher. The class was so fun and not very much work. It consisted of an easy midterm and a fun podcast project with a few assorted readings.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Walter is amazing, everyone has to take a class with him! Classes are really engaging and enjoyable with him. There are weekly discussion posts that help you respond to relevant cases of misinformation. There is also a short fact–checking assignment that you work on with your partner that allows you to delve deep and understand the absurdity of misinformation. There is 1 midterm exam, which is really not bad if you go to class and do the readings. The final is a podcast episode with a group which allows you to be creative! The content is super applicable and important to learn in the age of misinformation. Overall, it was a really fun course and I would 100% take a class with Professor Walter again."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really enjoyed this course! You learn a lot of real–world, applicable information about how information is presented online, how to identify and correct misinformation, and what theories might explain susceptibility to misinformation. Course assignments are pretty chill, and as long as you review the slides and course readings for the midterm (along with the midterm slide study guide), you will be absolutely fine. Podcast assignment is also fun!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is great and very interesting. Prof. Valter did an awesome job at keeping the lectures engaging and interactive. The subject matter itself is fascinating and this is a class I would recommend for majors or for people who simply want to learn more about the topic.
,,,,,,,,,,,AMAZING! Class is the best!
,,,,,,,,,,,Good class overall. One midterm and final project with weekly discussion posts and smaller smatterings of assignments. Lectures could be hard to pay attention in and Nathan really wanted an engaged audience and often did not get it.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Nathan and Callie are a great teaching team which makes the class super fun and enjoyable. Learned a lot, definitely recommend taking."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Nathan is THE BEST!! Take this class and take it with him. Super interesting content and the prof is clearly very enthusiastic about the topics. The workload is manageable (weekly discussion posts, a simple fact–checking assignment, a midterm exam, 2 small prep assignments for the final podcast, and a final group podcast). Participation is also super important in the class, so be sure to share in class and engage with the lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Nathan is an expert on all of the content, so take advantage of that and pick his brain. The assignments are meant to showcase your knowledge –– no tricks or anything that is not straightforward. The midterm is easy if you go to class and pay attention (average was mid–high 80s). Take this class if you're looking for an interesting, relevant, and fun class that will challenge you intellectually without harming the GPA."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Loved the structure, the teaching, the examples. Fair evaluation. Midterm was challenging for some students so make sure to study/prepare."
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this course! The material was so relevant to issues in the world today without venturing too far from content in other classes. Also Nathan is the best – he is truly a great professor who makes classes fun and engaging; you want to pay attention and learn from him. One thing I enjoyed greatly about the class was how varied the assignments were. None of them felt impossible to tackle but felt more engaging than only having to write essays. Would totally recommend taking this class!
comm,comm_st,315,fall,Dilip Gaonkar,4.50,4.30,4.10,4.00,4.50,3.40,Found lectures to be super disengaging as they are an hour and a half of the professor droning about the readings without even taking a moment to breathe. Attendance required and checked which sucks when the professor doesn't add much beyond the readings. Points given for participation but there is no discussion during lectures – it's just the professor talking. Assignments are easy but grades felt random. Final paper was way too long.
,,,,,,,,,,,Good course to take if you're interested in social movements at all. Covered some super important topics in history and today.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not the biggest fan of the narratives promoted in class, but I am very happy that I got the chance to learn more about the history and the structures of social movement organizations. Professor Gaonkar is also a very nice person willing to build a good connection with the students, so he made the class meetings fine. However, I think that the reading responses and concept papers were graded quite harshly by the TA because for a Comm class one would expect to not be seeing 9/10 as the highest grade for any student on most of those assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof lectures the ENTIRE class – there is literally zero student engagement – and just states exactly what is in the assigned readings for the day. He shows very graphic videos about social issues without trigger warnings. Do not recommend.
comm,comm_st,317,winter,Dilip Gaonkar,4.36,4.27,4.55,4.39,4.13,4.82,"The course in general was interesting and challenging. If there was less papers, it would be better because it was quite intense."
,,,,,,,,,,,The assignment were pretty much straightforward 3 small essays and one midterm paper and one 7 page final. Just follow the rubric
,,,,,,,,,,,"As someone who was really excited about this class topic, I am very disappointed. I do not think I learned much at all this quarter. A majority of the class focused on ancient democracy, rather than contemporary issues like I expected. Further, the professor spent each class simply lecturing at students, and it was extremely disengaging. The assigned at–home readings were very dry, and I struggled to see how any of the themes we discussed in class related to Communication Studies. Finally, the Powerpoint slides used by the Professor in class were not helpful notes at all, and it was very difficult to go back and review the content needed for the essays."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think the topic was initially very interesting, but I was unimpressed with the class overall because it was not interactive at all. There were no videos, movies, or discussions to get us involved with the information."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course offers a good chance to learn about different forms of democracies that were in place in various countries so that we have a proper idea what to do and what not to do in certain situations. Professor Gaonkar is an amazing person and a great lecturer and it was enjoyable to listen to him teach.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Our TA Ryan was great, he grades fairly and he provides help when needed. Lectures are pretty dense and the professor has a lot of information to give. Lots of writing, but an easier course than you might think."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you want to take a COMM class that finally is about something other than social media, take this course. You actually learn something unlike most COMM classes. I had a great time."
,,,,,,,,,,,"An easy elective, but classes are mandatory. 3 short papers, midterm and final paper."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is just sitting and listening to Dilip talk for 1 hour and 20 minutes. There is zero class engagement, and I have no idea how this is considered a comm class. This is a glorified political science class. Dillip will lecture about a type of democracy for the entire time, and no one participates in class because he does not open it up to commentary. The papers are easy and short, and Ryan is a helpful/accomodating TA. I would not recommend this class if you are interested in communication studies. It is not a comm class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Interesting class. 3 short papers and 2 longer ones. The readings are very well chosen. I recommend taking it
comm,comm_st,339,winter,Courtney Scherr,5.40,5.20,4.80,4.50,5.60,3.00,"Professor Scherr is AMAZING! She is so personable and such an engaging instructor. As someone interested in health communication, I thoroughly enjoyed this course and want to take more with Professor Scherr! The class organization was not difficult to manage, and Professor Scherr was very understanding of potential conflicts throughout the quarter and made sure to account for these while structuring the grading point system and class curriculum. I enjoyed how much flexibility there was to this class and how much discussion–based learning took place."
,,,,,,,,,,,I didn't know anything about the medical field at all going in and feel like I learned a lot about how precision medicine works and how important communicating about genetic information is.
comm,comm_st,340,fall,Paul Howard Arntson,5.82,5.47,5.35,4.18,5.59,3.22,"Paul is so knowledgable about the disabled community (or the labeled community, which he prefers to use). This is a 3 hour class once a week but he lets us out at least an hour early every week. Most weeks, there is a guest speaker that comes in to talk about the week's topic. The workload is very light: one page reading response a week, a short feedback paragraph for each class, and a final group project (about 2 pages per person). As long as you submit stuff on time, it's a guaranteed A. My class was also full of athletes so there was lots of leeway for excuses to miss class and turn in assignments a day late."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Love Paul! One of my favorite professors at Northwestern so far – super chill and go with the flow kind of guy, but also extremely knowledgeable and experienced. This class was definitely one of my favorites as well!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really love this course. I think every student at Northwestern should take it. The class structure is straight forward, and Paul really cares about helping you learn about such an important and difficult topic. You definitely get out of it what you put into it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"THIS IS THE BEST CLASS AT NORTHWESTERN PLEASE TAKE IT RIGHT NOW! Other than being a very chill class it is one of the classes that made me reflect the most. I was literally looking forward to come to this class every week. The content is greatly structured and the guest speakers are amazing. Professor Arntson is the nicest human on earth and he is very funny. I literally had couple tears after a class, SO EMOTIONAL. I honestly think I learned more in this class that in the majority of required classes. The material makes you look at the world around you differently and raises awareness on a very important topic that is often overseen. We only had a SHORT weekly in–class and at home reflection and an easy final project where you get to explore a topic of your choice. TAKE THIS CLASS!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great course. I was taking it just for fun, and I loved it. The workload is super easy and interesting. Paul is great. The readings were interesting, but it can be challenging material at times. Very important class to take. It will help you see the world in a new way."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great course – speaker–based and very eye–opening. Paul is a wonderful prof!
,,,,,,,,,,,Take this class with Paul! It is the easiest A ever and he is the best. I took this from 6–9 on wed and he never kept us past 8 once.
,,,,,,,,,,,The class was very easy. Paul brings in a guest speaker every class and you listen to them talk. The only thing you have to turn in at the end of class is a class reflection. And then before every class you submit a reading reflection. And there is a group final paper. Such a great course!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class. It is easy but also super interesting. Guest speakers each week that keep you engaged the whole time. A 3 hour class, but does not normally go the whole 3 hours."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The readings and class discussions were very interesting. I enjoyed hearing from the frequent guest speakers. Also, Paul is extremely caring and is a great professor to have. This course had a low time commitment but I still learned a lot of valuable information about the challenges people with disabilities face each day."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was great and not hard at all. The teacher was amazing, the workload was very manageable, and the guest speakers were great."
,,,,,,,,,,,One of the most amazing classes you can take at northwestern. Take it if you can you won’t regret it.
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Arntson is an incredible and inspirational person who transmits amazing energy and a lot of personal experience in a wonderful way. The class is easy and the assignments are not too demanding which combined with professor's humor and energy makes this course very enjoyable.
comm,comm_st,351,winter,Darren Gergle,5.79,5.00,4.84,4.47,5.42,7.21,"Prof. Gergle is an incredible professor. Very knowledgable and approachable, and more than accommodating if you request additional time or help. I recommend this class to anyone interested in UX design, as Gergle makes this class both interesting and worthwhile."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was more work than expected. It was very heavy with work at the end, with our final exams, final presentations, and final projects all being due around the same time. I wrote a 19 page single spaced paper for the midterm so I would recommend doing the in–person exams, which I did for our final. It was a 17–page final, but so much easier than the take–home exam. I really ended up learning a lot in this class as our assignments directly related to things we were learning in the class. Our final was group work and I personally had a really great group so I don't have complaints, but could see how it would be difficult to write a ten page paper if your group mates don't do any work. I think that Gergle is a great professor. He is funny and has energy in the morning and really wants us to do well. He's not out to get us, is very understanding, and is really good at what he does."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I took this class as a technical elective for the computer science major. There is no coding in this class, all homework assignments are written. The workload starts picking up toward the end of the quarter, but stays manageable if you don't wait until the last minute to start. There is a group final project and two exams (your choice of in class, take home, or paper), as well as readings (that you should try not to fall behind on because some of the content is on the exams). I really liked Prof. Gergle, and classes were always engaging despite being early in the morning. As a CS major, I wish there was a bit more coding involved in the class, but since it's also a comm class that's not really possible I guess. Prof. Gergle is so kind and understanding, so if something comes up and you need an extension or other accommodation DEFINITELY reach out."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was great! There's a lot of reading each week which is wasn't really expecting but all of it is really applicable to the class concepts and pretty interesting. I like how there were multiple ways to accumulate participation points in class (replying to discussion posts, talking in class, etc.). There were also 3 options for exams (in–class, take home and an independent research project). The in class exam was much more memorization which isn't bad if you have the time to study for it. The take home exam is SO long but it was nice to have the option during a busier week. If you have the time, I'd definitely recommend the in class option. The teaching team is also really great at communicating ideas and I think I learned a lot about the design process."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good class. Gergle is super cool and a great lecturer. The content is good for intro to HCI concepts. HOWEVER, BEWARE, the exam options in this class are brutal. The take home can take upwards of 12+ hours of work. It is time consuming. Class project was fun but lot of work at times"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class should be focused on either individual homework or project based assignments. I felt it was a bit messy because we got into groups and still have to do individual assignments that does not further progress the project. Thus, I felt that there was not enough time to fully develop a good final project."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class. It's taught very well and relatively easy. Gergle is great
,,,,,,,,,,,"Super helpful if you're interested in HCI. Also, Gergle is a great teacher. He is kind and knows what he's talking about! The coursework is also great for a portfolio if you want to go into UI/UX."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a good intro to HCI. I would definitely recommend having taken a design, computer science, or cognitive science class first. Grading is really flexible, though take–home exams are far longer than anticipated consistently. Course takes a deceptively high amount of time overall, but it's generally worth it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The presentations are great! Gergle is a rockstar. But the group work needs some rethinking I think. I would recommend keeping groups to no more than 3 people apiece, and also reworking the project presentation component here (why record a video then just all go to class and watch them? better perhaps to record presentations than randomly assign students like 3–4 to watch and write a reflection or something on)."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is super excellent and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in the concepts behind designing tech interfaces. Prof. Gergle is super passionate and really great in lectures. The group project assignments are also very manageable and the overall workload is very reasonable––just make sure to start the assignments early and work through them at a good pace. The course also has several modalities for exams (in person / take home / paper) so you can really tailor it to your learning style.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, this course was straightforward and at times, interesting to learn about. The class environment is very pleasant and Professor Gergle does a good job of reflecting his enthusiasm for the subject in his lectures. That being said, the amount of busy work in this class is incredibly tedious and time–consuming. Twice a week, there are at least 25 pages of reading and a reflection due before class on top of lengthy written homework assignments and exams. The take–home exams can easily exceed 10 pages in written content if you are thorough. However, I can't complain too much as your grade is entirely in your control, and getting an A simply requires completing every assignment."
comm,comm_st,360,fall,Ignacio Cruz,5.38,5.25,5.13,4.38,5.50,3.50,This course tackled some challenging higher level topics of organization through readings and then lecture time was devoted to understanding the history of these theories and explaining them in more detail. Each week students completed a module to check their understanding for course content. There was a midterm and final assignment which were focused on choosing a specific section of course content and applying it.
,,,,,,,,,,,This course actually opened my eyes to the possibility of consulting as a career and has kick–started my job search in this area. I am still exploring areas as a career but I was grateful that this class enabled me to include different career options that I otherwise would have not considered.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great, light but very interesting course that really effectively translated organizational theories into applicable content and assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Cruz is amazing! One of the best professors I've had at Northwestern. He made an effort to get to know his students personally and was always willing to answer our questions / provide support. Highly recommend the class — the lectures were fun and engaging, with cute activities that allowed us to combine what we learned into a more hands–on context. There wasn't a large amount of workload, where we had weekly ""modules"" with assigned reading, blog–type questions, etc. A very manageable class with rewarding topics as it relates to the workforce. Take this class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Cruz is the GOAT
,,,,,,,,,,,Love Prof. Cruz as a person however I feel like he is still finding is teaching style and I think this course could have been structured much better. For example I think the class would be much more engaging it we were not just sitting in lecture and it was more discussion based. I think having a reading due for each class that would guide our discussion of organizational communication would make it much more fun. also sitting in more of an arch so I can see my classmates; its kind of sad that I know literally only two peoples names.
comm,comm_st,367,fall,Michelle Shumate,5.47,5.41,5.24,4.76,5.06,3.76,It was a great course that was structured very well.
,,,,,,,,,,,"really interesting class working with real nonprofits! reading was often dry and surface level, but otherwise the class discussions and case studies were engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,Love Professor Shumate. Amazing class
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a great course to take. It’s project based no exams. You work in a group the entire time helping a nonprofit that you chose. There are a couple quizzes you’ll have to take based on what you learned that week in class. It’s an easier workload if you’re looking for that.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was incredible. I got to work in a group throughout the quarter with a nonprofit client that was so sweet. I learned so much about communicating with actual clients and got a lot of real world experience. I also got exposure to the nonprofit world. Overall, the class was so rewarding."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Shumate made my group and I feel well–supported while working with our client and she provided good feedback. The assignments unrelated to our client work sometimes felt a bit like busy work, but the cases were interesting and I luckily had a good group to work with."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was great! Learned a ton about the nonprofit sector and the assignments were reasonable. There is a bit of busy work, but it’s all easy to complete. The quizzes are open note and the lowest one gets dropped. Overall the grading structure is easy, the class content is engaging, the consulting project is interesting, and the professor really cares about all of her students:"
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof. Shumate is a great instructor and this is a very practical course. You work with a real nonprofit client on improving their communication in some form throughout the quarter. There also is a large component of watching lectures and doing readings outside of class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a phenomenal course. Professor Shumate is FANTASTIC and this is by far the most immersive class I have taken at Northwestern. The opportunity to get to work with a nonprofit throughout the quarter was so cool and rewarding. The course work is not too bad, just a few quizzes and random assignments besides the client deliverables. Not hard to get an A. One of my favorite classes at NU!"
,,,,,,,,,,,The consulting project is great and the professor is very passionate about this topic. A really cool class and I would highly recommend taking it.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Some busy work with readings, at–home/open–note quizzes, and discussion boards. But the project makes up for these aspects."

comm,comm_st,376,winter,Aymar Christian,5.53,5.29,4.94,4.94,5.24,4.65,The course explores the television industry from various different themes. The readings explain different aspects of the television industry and the screenings further explore these themes. The class time is spent providing background and supplemental information to the readings and discuss the screenings for the week.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was one of my favorites out of all the classes I've taken at Northwestern. The three hour class goes by quickly because the lectures are very engaging and mostly discussion based. Relatively easy work load, a few screenings and readings every week but they're easy to absorb. Professor AJ is such a great professor, they keep it real and facilitate discussions to be very interesting, would've loved to take another class taught by them!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Contemporary television will always be one of my favourite classes at Northwestern. If you're even mildly interested in the television/ entertainment industry, take this class! It covers the industry from all angles– distribution, technology, actual narrative and representation of the show. The readings are relevant and quite interesting if you're into tv. The only thing I'd say is they can be quite long, but it gives you the chance to practice the art of skimming! Also the readings are gone over in class, so you never feel like you're missing anything vital. Very good structure of the class with breaks allowed, so overall a comprehensive coverage of the academic sphere of television."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was a great class about the history and current state of TV, I felt like I learned a lot of insights about the industry. Def worth taking"
,,,,,,,,,,,"No questions, take this class. Dr AJ is a fantastic professor that makes 3 hours fly by with engaging content and riveting discussion. The readings can be a bit challenging but not enough to deter one from enjoying the class"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVED this course! Any three hour class is a bit of a struggle, but at least this one was interesting and I knew that I'd be engaged the whole way through. Dr. AJ is beyond accommodating, with very flexible due dates for assignments and the freedom to participate either online or in class (as someone who doesn't like to raise my hand in class, I can't express how helpful this was). Readings are super interesting, and can be directly applied to each week's viewings to really see concepts in action. The Critical Karaoke assignment is so creative and fun, and I loved not only making mine but also watching all of my classmates' throughout the quarter. Homework isn't overwhelming, midterm papers are graded fairly, and the final paper assignment is super interesting. Class discussion was a highlight of this course, since we really got to talk about our favorite shows and niche media, and cultivated true dialogue with both each other and Dr. AJ. I'm sure everyone already wants to take this course already, but I truly cannot recommend it enough!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty simple and straightforward class. One video essay assignment, one midterm assignment (final paper proposal), and a final paper (also participation each week). Felt like a combination of my past RTVF classes had led me to a lot of these lessons before (History of the Recording Industry, Analyzing Television) but it was still solid. Dr. AJ is also very kind and understanding and wants to create a class that bests serves his students, which I really appreciated!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This was such a great course. You learn so much about the industry and TV. I always learn so much from Dr. AJ's classes. He assigns the best viewings/readings and gives outstanding lectures.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I wasn't that interested in Contemporary Television or RTVF before taking this course but I heard such great things about Professor AJ that I decided to take it. I don't regret it at all. It's 3 hours long but Professor AJ keeps you so entertained and the course material is super interesting. Definitely learn how to skim effectively for the course readings to save yourselves some time. You have one video assignment, a ""midterm"" paper (final paper proposal), participation, and a final paper (8–10pages). Overall, enjoyed this class and am so happy I took it!"
,,,,,,,,,,,The three hour classes are always challenging but the structure of the class throughout the quarter and its assignments are great. Dr. Christian is an awesome Professor.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was alright, it was nothing special and it was kind of boring. It was clear that the professor had recycled slides for years."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class! Dr. C is the best – he's so passionate about the topic, engaging, and keeps the class very relevant to today. Though the assignments may seem overwhelming at first, they are actually very doable and interesting if you choose a topic that you like. Dr. C is also helpful if you talk to him 1 on 1 about your topic/ideas. I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in TV and entertainment!"
comm,comm_st,380,spring,Erik Nisbet,5.53,5.47,5.63,5.25,5.60,3.76,"I really enjoyed this course. Professor Nisbet is very passionate and knowledgeable about this subject, so it was great to learn from him. The courseload is relatively light – midterm & final paper, 1 debate, and a few film reflections."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Fantastic class. Prof Nisbet is an awesome lecturer, and the discussions in class were some of the most interesting I've heard in a classroom. A little depressing, potentially, I don't think it did much to make me optimistic about the future of democracy in the US, but still supremely interesting. Made me happy to wake up for a 9:30 at Frances Searle."
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this course! It is very relevant and intellectually stimulating. Definitely would recommend to any political science and/or communications majors.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Every journalism student interested in politics should take this class. If you have a background on the intersection of politics and the media, this class will be especially fun because it will make you think about the entire media system and its economics. It's not particularly difficult (a few quick reflection papers and then a midterm and final take–home), but it has changed my outlook on the media. Prof. Nisbet is engaging and interesting and cares about his students."
,,,,,,,,,,,Very easy class. He takes attendance in every class. You have a debate that you have to do. 4 papers based on films you watch. A midterm essay and a final essay. He grades easy and the assignments aren't hard. You learn a lot about politics. Great class!
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's really easy to do well in this class, but definitely found it hard to motivate to do all the assignments. You definitely don't need to do all the readings since the lectures are literally just summaries, but they're helpful for the midterm papers and film stuff."
,,,,,,,,,,,Amazing class! Absolutely loved it and learned a lot!
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was extremely enlightening and the content would be valuable to anybody considering a career in politics, marketing, and even social activism. It is a fascinating mix of psychology, sociology, and rhetorical analysis that makes students much more aware and critical of the messages they receive in everyday life. Definitely take it!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a GREAT political communications class!! Super straightforward assignments, interesting topics, and Professor Nisbet is passionate about the subject which is contagious for all of us. I highly recommend taking this!! Easy A, and you also learn a TON of interesting stuff"

,,,,,,,,,,,"LOVED the class. Such a shame professor wartella is retiring. She was quite literally the sweetest and most interesting instructors ever. The content was super interesting, half the class was always based off discussions, we talked about current events. The exams were very fair."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a light course that is interesting and thought–provoking. The assignments aren't hard at all and the best part of this class was how it made me want to talk about class content outside of class. The content is super timely and the instructors came well–prepared.
,,,,,,,,,,,I liked it
,,,,,,,,,,,Love the Professor she was so cool!! This course was very easy. You have to be a discussion leader once and it’s chill. The midterms and final are easy too
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a class where basically everyone gets an A unless you screw up really really badly. I didnt have to do much throughout the quarter; just show up to class and answer discussion questions. There are 2 exams but they're at home and online. Ellen is also a wonderful person and professor, but she's retiring this year so i dont know how the class will be organized with a different professor."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great course, and I was so glad to take it with Ellen before her retirement. Her experience and attitude is what made this class so amazing, and I wish she could be around forever to teach it. Overall, as long as you attended lectures, you gained all the information you needed. We had a midterm, final, and one day of leading discussion, but overall, I gained a lot of knowledge for the course being a relatively low time committment. Definitely take this!"
,,,,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed the psychological and sociological aspect to this class.
comm,comm_st,394,fall,Larissa Buchholz,5.88,5.33,5.22,5.11,5.67,5.67,"It's a bit of a scattered course curriculum–wise, but you get a ton of freedom and Prof. Buchholz is an incredible and super helpful professor."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Larissa is a fantastic professor. I took this class because I had to take a seminar in junior year, but it ended up becoming one of my favorite classes at Northwestern. There are reading notes every week and a final paper, but Larissa makes everything so low–stress because she takes the class through each step of the paper so there is no cramming. Also, the readings could be difficult to understand sometimes but Larissa took care to always send out a reading guide which was super helpful. If you're considering this course for your seminar option, I would say go for it!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was amazing. Professor is so kind, smart, and really cares about your success. The class is super manageable and really emphases how to get a strong research proposal. Final isn't duanting at all and you work throughout the whole quarter to polish it. Overall great class, the three hours are long, but worth it if you are interesting in doing your own research. TAKE THIS REQUIREMENT WITH BUCHOLZ."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The professor was super accommodating, encouraging and enthusiastic! Definitely felt like a good place to learn"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great course and Prof. Buchholz always cares about your learning and well–being. She takes you step by step in the research process. I enjoyed how stimulating the materials and discussion were, as this was my first introduction to learning about creativity as a construct. I highly recommend this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Overall I was not very excited about this course but I ended up enjoying it. The three hours were pretty long but only having to go to the course once a week was nice. There was a decent amount of reading but it was manageable and the professor asked weekly if it was too much to handle. For the final paper we worked on it in small parts throughout the quarter making it easier to complete it in the end
comm,comm_st,394,winter,Jack Bandy,6.00,5.90,5.60,5.40,6.00,5.67,"you will learn a lot, and 20 page paper isn't scary as it seems because the course helps you to write throughout the quarter"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was great! Jack is an awesome instructor and it's obvious how much work he's put into the organization of this course–– each week was broken down clearly amongst topics and he knows so much about the subjects. The readings and documentaries we had to read/watch were sometimes time consuming, but discussion in class was great and everything was so interesting that it really didn't feel like work. Jack was genuinely invested in making sure that we understood the topics and were getting something out of the course, which I really appreciated. He gave us great feedback on our presentations and papers, and the fact that he broke up the writing of the 20 page paper into different steps throughout the quarter (initial proposal, outline, first draft, second draft, etc) made it feel a lot less overwhelming because I had different deadlines to meet for different parts of the paper–– by the time I really had to sit down and finish it, most of it was done already. All in all, I really enjoyed this course and I think Jack did a fantastic job–– I don't think he'll be teaching this course again, but I'd recommend it and him to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Jack is awesome!!! Class was super engaging and relevant, and the topics we discussed all had real–world technological impacts. We all got to choose topics of interest that were related to the technology field, and Jack makes the deadlines really manageable (writing a 20 page paper is pretty daunting, but Jack was really supportive and the spacing of deadlines was super helpful in completing the paper). Definitely take this class to fulfill the 394 requirement; you’ll learn a lot, the grading is easy, and Jack is awesome."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Jack Bandy is one of my favourite professors I've had at Northwestern. He's unusually kind and caring about his students, he makes a special point of acting in the interest of his student's mental health, and is generally just delightful. Students from this section formed The Bandies. Membership is free, you need only pledge your undying loyalty to one Jack Bandy. Truly a legend, and a really special class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"JACK IS THE BEST AND HE WILL HELP YOU THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS, TAKE IT WITH HIM!!!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Jack Bandy is an amazing professor that can discuss complicated topics with students well. The class was a positive learning environment that encouraged discussions from student–professor and student–student. He was willing to work through problems with students and help accommodate their needs. I wish I had more professors like Jack Bandy.
comm,comm_st,394,winter,Camille Saucier,5.93,5.71,5.71,5.14,5.71,5.85,"If you are a junior trying to figure out which writing seminar to take, TAKE THIS ONE and TAKE IT WITH CAMILLE! I am so glad I ended up in this class, because it was super relevant to what my career interests are. I learned so much about what makes persuasive strategies work. The readings can be a lot at times, but the paper is spread out throughout the quarter so we didn't get bogged down. Camille is also the best, she genuinely tries to connect with all the students that she can, and is so helpful with writing our first big research paper. I cannot recommend this class enough, especially if you are interested in persuasion, advertising, marketing, etc."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Aside from this class being very helpful for students (especially) entering marketing, Camille was an amazing instructor that always kept the class educational and interesting. She created a very safe and comfortable class environment and encouraged a lot of participation. She was always on top of grading and providing feedback. I know Camille is going to be a great professor, post–graduation, and I am excited to see her potentially teach some classes at Northwestern."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot throughout this course, and there were regular opportunities to apply and review theories learned in class. I also appreciated the structure of the class in which we alternated between learning theory and improving writing techniques."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Camille is a great instructor, and she is caring, kind, and very supportive throughout the course. While I don't find the peer feedback session particularly constructive, I really like the shark tank activity. My writing improved as well."
,,,,,,,,,,,The course focused on different readings about persuasive methods used in messages. The different theories or readings were then discussed and further explained during class. The course's final paper focuses on examining how different persuasion techniques and strategies were used in an advertisement or message the student selects.
,,,,,,,,,,,I was surprised by how many techniques we learned to help support an argument and make it effectively sticky
,,,,,,,,,,,"LOVE CAMILLE! She is the best. She really made this course awesome. She truly cares about everyone and makes it super clear that she does. Not only is she one of the most understanding and real professors I have ever had, she taught us so much. I was super nervous about writing this much beforehand but it was literally so manageable. So as a comms junior we all have to take this class, but I HIGHLY recommend taking it with Camille."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course! The 20 page final paper seems daunting at first, but I cannot emphasize enough how helpful it was that Camille had us work on it piece by piece throughout the quarter. If you're interested in marketing or advertising, this is the class for you. I found myself referencing this class plenty of times in my interviews."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course and liked the depth we went into when learning about why messages in all forms are, or are not 'sticky'."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Camille is soooo nice, I recommend taking this class with her. this class could be boring at times but each class focused on one ""sticky"" marketing campaign tactic per class or writing a research paper. but Camille really is so nice and helpful and really cares about her students"
,,,,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed this course because all the work we do leads up to the final paper. I didn't feel overwhelmed by the final paper because we slowly worked toward it so it doesn't feel like a lot.
comm,comm_st,394,winter,Floor Fiers,5.33,5.00,5.67,5.44,5.22,6.56,"It was a challenging, but fun process and I liked how small the class was and how intimate our discussions were."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is set up in a really good way to help students better understand the writing process of long, academic papers. By going step–by–step, I really got to understand the nuances of the writing process."
,,,,,,,,,,,Really interesting course. Floor made writing 20 pages a lot easier with the layout of the course. I thought the topic of the course was really interesting too
,,,,,,,,,,,"Floor is a great instructor and gives great insight and feedback to students. I also feel that whenever we posed questions and advice for improvement, it was always well received by Floor. I feel very glad about how much my writing improved due to this course. I wish we sometimes had less readings for the class so we could focus on the reading for our own research, or that we could update and discuss the readings we were doing for our own project"
,,,,,,,,,,,Floor is a very good teacher and they are nice. the grading part caused some confusion but overall this class is great. I learned a lot
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was generally super nervous to take 394 as a Comm Studies requirement but am ultimately super happy I took this specific section. I learned so much about digital inequality, and the course has significantly changed the way I think about technology; the topics were super relevant and interesting (we talked about these subjects on Tuesdays). My writing and argumentation styles of papers have also significantly changed/improved as a result of this course (we talked about writing and research on Thursdays). The class is set up to help you succeed and avoid getting overwhelmed, with progressive assignments being due throughout the quarter that ultimately lead to a 20 page research proposal. Alongside these assignments, there are also weekly discussion posts on readings and a few peer reviews. Some assignments are graded based on ""completion"" while others are graded on quality. Floor is an amazing instructor who truly cares about students' improvement and success. The class was a bit nervous about the grading scale at the beginning of the quarter, but future assignments were set up to help people improve significantly. Floor is super accommodating when it comes to changing deadlines and they recognize that people have other classes and work in the mix. They will challenge your thinking and definitely won't hold your hand, but if you take advantage of office hours and ask questions, they will be there at every step to help work through each person's topic and make it the best it can be. You'll have your ups and downs no matter which 394 section you take, but will ultimately be proud of the work you've done. I would definitely recommend taking this course on Digital Inequality with Floor Fiers!"
comm,comm_st,394,spring,Sarah Idzik,5.80,5.80,5.60,5.00,5.60,6.20,Interesting course that offers good insight into race as a socially constructed concept and all the issues related to the improper use of race as something that divides society into groups. Assignments were interesting and provoked a deeper thought and analysis which was quite helpful in understanding the main arguments related to this theme.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was initially nervous about how few people were taking this class but it ended up being one of my favorite aspects of the class. The small class size allowed all my questions to be addressed in class and the instructor did an amazing job of setting up a comfortable environment for us. Overall, this was a super chill class with a great instructor and I learned a lot about a very important topic."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVE THIS CLASS ABSOLUTELY!!! I was really interested in the subject (construction of race) and my experience is amazing. Sarah was great –– she is knowledgable, has a speciality, and is genuine interest in this topic. All the texts are intentionally chosen. She really cares about the students by not giving us too much work (final paper is required to be at least 10 pages compared to other junior seminars that require 20 pages). I think this is a one–of–a–time experience."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Genuinely one of the best classes I have taken through SoC. Sarah is one of the most engaging teachers I have ever had – she knows her stuff, she's empathetic, she's extremely sociable, and just all around a super awesome person to learn from. If you're interested in race and theory, the readings we were assigned during this class would definitely be of interest to you. I liked the small class size and felt that the cultural/ethnic representation in the class really made the discussions worthwhile. Everyone was very respectful and eager to learn. Sarah is so supportive and genuinely wants all of her students to succeed. Best comm faculty member I've had hands down."
comm,comm_st,395,fall,Bruce Lambert,5.75,5.54,5.38,4.69,5.83,3.86,Interesting class! It really gets you thinking about the psychosocial approach to medicine and how our current system is failing to treat chronic illness. The professor is engaging and the workload is very manageable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was pretty interesting and easy. Would definitely recommend. I wish the essays were not so long, it seemed like overkill."
,,,,,,,,,,,every pre–med should take this class. lambert is an incredible lecturer – super engaging and clearly cares about the content. he's also really personable and makes the 3 hour block fly by. the content in this class is very important for anyone entering any part of the healthcare field.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was fantastic! Professor Lambert is a great lecturer, the readings are pretty approachable and the subject matter is both interesting and useful."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class, super interesting topic and it's clear that Prof Lambert is super knowledgeable and passionate on the subject."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Lambert is great and energetic! It was really interesting to learn about chronic illness from a sociological lens, but the lectures started to feel repetitive by the end of the quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,LOVED this class!! Professor Lambert was great and really stimulated interest in this topic. Chronic illness was not something I fully grasped / was very understanding of until now. Highly recommend this course
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was really interesting and is really applicable to our everyday lives and the people we interact with. I learned a lot about chronic illness and the experience of chronic illness that I will take with me and how I treat people I know struggling with chronic illness. I didn't have much knowledge about the medical care system but the course allowed me to grasp a greater understanding of the philosophies and values held behind them.
,,,,,,,,,,,Lectures were so engaging and interesting– overall great class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Highly recommend this course for any student interested in entering the medical field! It really changes your perspective on how to deliver care more effectively and equitably, especially for patients with chronic illness. Prof. Lambert is so knowledgeable about the topic and a super chill person. There isn't too much work: each week you have to answer a couple questions on the readings and write a super short reflection from lecture. Each are graded for completion. There are 2 research papers which are graded pretty relaxed. Even though the class is 3 hrs, we often got out after 2–2.5 hrs. This is a great class for a GH elective as well. As a pre–med, I took away so much for this class that will definitely change how I approach medicine in the future. TAKE THIS CLASS!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Dr. Lambert is the sweetest person. Take the class if not just for him. He's very funny and engaging and he cares a lot about his students. Adored him! The class itself made me view the world with more empathy. It can be heavy but it's very interesting to see the case studies of illness. The papers challenged me intellectually to put it all together. Loved this class even tho it was a little dark.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Enjoyed this course so much. Professor Lambert is a fantastic professor and really made the 3–hour classes manageable (and fun)! He is generally very knowledgeable in health communications and enjoys the field. The readings and work were manageable but most importantly, VERY interesting. If you're interested in healthcare, medicine, health management/administration, or public health – this is the PERFECT class for you. Can't recommend it enough."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was by far one of my favorite courses I have taken at Northwestern. It was an incredibly insightful course and is such an important class that anyone going into medicine should be required to take. As someone with a chronic illness, it was also very valuable to me to have this experience of learning about the experience of illness and the ways one can ""overcome"" their incurable illness."
comm,comm_st,395,winter,Robert Hariman,5.10,4.90,5.00,4.70,4.80,3.80,I thought this was a very interesting course. It opened my eyes about how to advocate for the environment through art. There were a lot of cool readings and photos in this class. The classes were mainly discussing readings and photos.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course. It is super relevant and interesting and I actually learned a lot. Workload is completely manageable, just repetitive which is totally fine. Class is also repetitive but I really enjoyed the topics and the pictures we talked about in class. Probably favorite class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Solid comm class. Definetly an interesting class if you are passionate about climate justice. Hariman can be a little intimidating, but he really just wants his students to grow as much as possible. A few papers and big final project that can creep up on you. Lecture can be a little slow, but sometimes the content is super interesting. Overall a great class that is not a lot of work."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Easy course and the professor was interested in the subject. Each class is pretty much the same, you discuss readings and images. I don't think I learned a lot but it was a good collaborative class. You only have to do a discussion post every week and some smaller assignments throughout the quarter, pretty easy."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not my favorite comm class. I thought it was an interesting topic, but it wasn’t taught in the best way. The professor talks the entire time and I wish it was more interactive. You have homework, two individual assignments, and a group final project."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very interesting course for anyone that cares about the environment! A lot of readings weekly, discussion about art, and assignments are a blog post, paper, and a final group project"
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a great course that isn't too much work but actually really interesting. If you are interested in the environment make sure to take it. The readings are manageable and the assignments are very short papers or the final group project.
comm,comm_st,395,spring,Irving Jacob Rein,5.13,4.89,4.11,3.22,4.25,3.00,"This was a fun class and Prof. Rein was very engaging and enthusiastic about sports and media. I do not have any background in sports and limited sport knowledge, but I did not feel lost at all. The work was not hard at all and much of the information was interesting! This class helped me see sports media in a new light."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was decent, I love sports so it was fun to discuss things that were relevant to today, but it is hard to pay attention to the lecture style. I definitely learned a lot on my own through the group projects and papers, so if you're looking for an excuse to do homework that involves learning about sports, this is a great class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The classes definitely felt long. While I appreciated Professor Rein's love for the topic, I feel like some of his thoughts are out of date. I also would've loved to have heard more about other sports than just basketball and football. It definitely seemed like our TA was in charge of all the grading and feedback – it would've been great to hear the Professor's thoughts, but I understand why everything was communicated through the TA. Also, this class was not exactly ""marketing"" it was more like sports history."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really do think that the course needs to broaden its range of sports rather than focusing on American sports such as NFL and NBA.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was completely centred around sports in the US without a focus on international sports or sports in any other countries. The examples used in class were all US–based. As an international student, I was unfamiliar with these examples and sports and therefore tended to lose my interest. I think a more international approach would have been beneficial where we could learn about sports marketing strategies that apply to sports worldwide. Moreover, the course taught me a lot about US sports and players but barely about marketing specifically. I wish the course had a greater focus on marketing strategies."
,,,,,,,,,,,The class has a very doable workload with 2 presentations and a final although the 3 hour class feels extremely long and monotonous.
comm,comm_st,395,spring,Sarah Syversen,5.90,5.50,4.80,5.80,4.90,3.40,LOVE this class!!!! Super interesting. You learn all about social media and mental health. Sarah is the best Professor I’ve had in COMM. Definitely take this course!!!
,,,,,,,,,,,This course does not take a lot of time. You just need to go to class and participate. There is some interesting stuff. If you’re interested in social media and mental health this is a good class for you.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I genuinely loved this course and would totally recommend it. Whether or not you've dealt with mental health issues, the content is super relevant and very interesting, especially considering how many college students use social media. There are a variety of assignments of which many are reflections on your own social media use; they are honestly so worth it and made me much more aware of my own usage. Examples of other assignments are responses to films, a social media ""fast"", and an op–ed. Sarah is a fabulous instructor who approaches these topics with sensitivity and recognition of potentially triggering topics. Take this course!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Sarah Syversen is super passionate about this! You learn a lot about mental health and the communities that exist around it
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class! Sarah is wonderful and the content was great. A lot of stuff I already knew, there's a lot of overlap with psych and other comm studies classes you might've taken before. Assignments were good, and Sarah's really understanding about everything."
,,,,,,,,,,,AMAZING course and love Sarah – always a great time with her. TAKE THIS CLASS! changed my life
,,,,,,,,,,,"SARAH IS THE BEST. FIGHT FOR AN EARLY PRE REG TIME AND TAKE THIS. This is class you can't pass up, it is super manageable because a lot of your brainpower will be used for contributing to good in class discussions. Sarah has a really cool late work policy where every assignment can be submitted a few days late. The most fair grader too, just follow the rubrics. Also an amazing lecturer. Participation is huge for this class but that means easy outside of class work. Show up ready to talk and easy A. Discussions can sometimes feel surface level though."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was very interesting! All the assignments and projects were truly engaging and fun! The professor was also amazing and very accommodating!
comm,comm_st,395,spring,Courtney Scherr,5.38,5.00,5.15,4.62,5.15,5.16,"Very easy class. We don't think a lot about risk, so it was nice. You have to complete homework assignments to get to a total of 40 points and have 3 papers that you can work on in groups. You also have to find a risk campaign and do a little presentation on it. Great class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,You learn the same things that you learn in other comm courses but Callie the TA was amazing and so nice
,,,,,,,,,,,"loved this class, didnt really know what risk comm was coming into this class and I was totally ok. was very interesting and engaging. the assingments are super straightforward and you do not need to do one every class"
,,,,,,,,,,,Take this class! She was amazing and made me realize that I may want to go into risk communication
,,,,,,,,,,,the readings are longgggg and scherr expects you to do reading homeworks each week which can be a lot. the final and papers are find. more work than other 3xx comm classes so only take if you think the subject is interesting
,,,,,,,,,,,Overall a pretty good course. I like the prof and the TA and you can tell they were really interested in the topic which helped us. Didn't take too much time and profs were reasonable with assignments. Just come to class and you'll be fine.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Well first off, Professor Scherr is a joy. So sweet, so understanding, I would take all of her classes. A lot of this class is theory and kinda ... simple stuff. Because of that, the class wasn't always engaged, and sometimes it felt like the TA and Professor assumed it was because we didn't understand content, rather than thought it was obvious. This is a super minor critique though. Speaking generally, the discussion emphasis the class had was awesome. The workload was super manageable. I would ABSOLUTELY take this again"
,,,,,,,,,,,The course makes you think critically about risk messages and what makes them most effective.
,,,,,,,,,,,I think the structure of the course was very interesting and super fun. The readings were interesting and the final project was great.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course talks about the concept of risk through a variety of readings on theories pertaining to risk management, some of the readings have an environmental focus and some have a medical focus. In the course students complete reading assignments for points in that assignment category. Students apply the theories from the reading to a selected risk message analyzed in a brief presentation. The course assignments have two papers, which culminate in a final project, all centered on the task of designing a risk message campaign in an area the student chooses."
bien,music,111,fall,Mathew Arrellin,4.33,4.47,4.60,4.40,4.20,5.14,"Learned a lot of new material that was not known before, but sometimes the expectations for class were not communicated clearly. Within the different sections, teachers taught more or less so when working with other students it felt as if I knew less than them."
,,,,,,,,,,,It was harder and faster than I expected.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The professor of this course was nice and there to help, but isn't very understanding. No clear grading scales, just based on what the professor feels about how many points to deduct on your work. The tests were never an accurate depiction of what we focused on during class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought that the course was really helpful with learning the different species. However, towards the end of the quarter, things sped up a lot so a lot more self–learning had to be incorporated."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course, though at times boring, was nice. The material was not very difficult to understand and Professor Arrellin was very nice, laid back, and patient with questions. It seemed like he really cared about students’ understanding. Instructions on assignments were sometimes difficult to understand and/or easily misleading. Overall, the workload for this course was very manageable with only one large assignment per module."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was his first year teaching this course, it was generally alright but there were a lot of moments in instruction especially towards the beginning where you're expected to fill in the blank during a lecture and the class goes on tangents and circles before we finally get told how the theory concept––which works for some classes but it just made this one confusing sometimes. It's the same material as the other theory classes, so at the end of the day you get the same information and tests. He was patient with questions which there were a lot of."
,,,,,,,,,,,It was great
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this class! It went into depth about topics well and was very organized.
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was sometimes frustrating but nothing unbearable. I learned a lot in a very short amount of time and can say it was pretty fun
,,,,,,,,,,,Sometimes we would spend a lot of time on one species of counterpoint and then rush through others. I feel like we should have more evenly split our time of the species.
bien,music,111,fall,Susan Piagentini,5.50,5.09,5.45,4.73,5.74,5.18,I felt that this course helped me develop the foundational understanding of music theory that I lacked before and that it has helped me improve a lot as a musician. I appreciated how class was engaging and assignments encouraged growth and creativity.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Aural was by far the hardest music course, and though I didn't enjoy it, it is a very useful course and helped me better understand patterns in music."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really liked how this course was structured. Each assignment built on top of one another in a way that made a lot of sense.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great intro to music theory class! It delves into why and how music works, and why things sound the way they do, which was very interesting to learn about. You get to create some of your own compositions towards the end of the quarter. The professor was very knowledgeable and explained concepts clearly."
,,,,,,,,,,,I honestly liked this course. I felt like I learned a lot and I feel that what I have learned is very useful for my life. Those are the main two factors that I think make for a good class.
,,,,,,,,,,,– Instructor explained material well and was patient
,,,,,,,,,,,– Coursework was intuitive
,,,,,,,,,,,– Final project was enjoyable
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was informative and easy to follow. The professor made sure that the class understood each concept before moving on and the homework was not overly time consuming.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I just wanted to start building a good foundation since I had none, and this course was perfect for that."
,,,,,,,,,,,I focused mostly on how to learn the basics because I haven't had any experience of it
,,,,,,,,,,,Dr. Piagentini is superb at instructing. She is also very kind and caring. MUSIC 111 is the most enjoyable class of my first quarter at NU.
bien,music,111,fall,Lam Wong,5.09,4.50,4.36,4.00,4.73,4.82,"The way the course was set up to progressively introduce new ideas made learning really manageable and affective, and honestly, kind of fun!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course is pretty easy and slow. A lot of the assignments are busy work and feel repetitive. The projects are ok, but again feel more like busy work even though they are meant to be creative and fun. Tests are relatively easy, and overall it's a pretty low pressure class."
,,,,,,,,,,,It was what I expected from a Theory 1 course.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good course, learned a lot. Dr. Wong is a great communicator and instructor. Don't miss classes or your grade will be deducted."
,,,,,,,,,,,"You'll learn the material for this class and in general there is not that much work. Dr. Wong knows the material, but can sometimes go off on tangents that don't directly tie to our current material. It's still interesting concepts, but I wish it was a little more focused in general. He is always very helpful when you contact him through email. If you miss class, he's always willing to zoom or find some other way for you to learn the material. Generally not too many complaints."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Sometimes a bit annoying, pace got much faster in the latter half of the class compared to the first half"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a helpful look into the foundations of music, focusing mainly on the different counterpoint species and techniques that composers use to emphasize tonic."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was fine. It wasn't particularly challenging content. In fact, it was much harder to prove your understanding of the content than it was to actually understand it. Sometimes I feel the assignments were a bit pointless or obtuse. But the content was fine."
bien,music,111,fall,Kenn Kumpf,5.10,4.80,5.00,5.40,5.00,6.60,"I really loved this course! Dr. Kumpf is super knowledgeable and my understanding of music theory has greatly increased. There is definitely more work for this class than the regular music theory sequence, but it's definitely worth it. I didn't like theory coming into this class, but it has ended up being one of my favorite classes this quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a decent amount of work. Unless you are really interested in music theory there isn't really a reason why you would take this class over just regular theory. There are weekly skill checks on top of midweek and weekend assignments. The final project is a bit rushed and it clashes with the final at the very end which makes it slightly stressful. You learn more in depth about concepts which can be interesting at times, but if you are trying to juggle other difficult classes, especially if you are dual degree, this class isn't worth it in my opinion. The tests are very open ended so there isn't really a right or wrong answer to the questions which is nice, but that isn't much of a consolation prize"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I felt as though this class had a lot of work, but it did teach me many new concepts and ideas that I can now apply to many genres and pieces of music. I will say the grading was not the most organized, and received grade very late."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Honors Music Theory has some fun, more involving assignments and takes a more holistic approach to music analysis which I appreciate. Professor Kumpf is very good at instruction, extremely enthusiastic, and does a great job of engaging his students. However, as of now (the Friday of finals week), probably about 1/3 of the assignments are graded, which is rather concerning in terms of having grades in, so feedback may be a little hard to come by."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is a lot more work than the normal music theory class, but worth it for people who know they'll pursue music in the future."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really liked this class! Initially, I was worried that it would be really focused on the arbitrary ""rules"" of classical music and that, as someone primarily interested in popular music, it wouldn't feel very relevant to my interests. However, this was far from the case. Dr. Kumpf is GREAT, and I love how we really dove into the reasoning behind some of these principles. He encouraged us to ditch the notion that certain things in music are ""right"" or ""wrong"", but the principles became more of a helpful tool to look at what makes certain moments in music (classical or otherwise) effective. The course was so interesting, and I'm so happy I took it :)"
bien,music,111,fall,Susan Piagentini,5.83,5.42,5.42,4.67,5.67,4.66,It is a very well–paced course that allows you to work at your speed but still makes sure that you get through all the material necessary for the quarter. There are a lot of opportunities to practice the concepts you are learning so you can always be aware of where your understanding is at in the class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty good, class time always felt like it was meaningful and moving forward. It was pretty slow at the start of the year though but did progress to interesting stuff pretty quickly."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was pretty much what i expected from a music theory course, no surprises. Solid and overall good"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course, taught by Dr. Piagentini, was a great introduction to music theory, and a warm and welcoming first quarter into the Bienen School of Music. Coming into to college, I was worried that my music theory class would be quite mundane, since much of my past theory experience was memorizing key signatures and vocabulary terms. However, this music theory course is organized and taught in such a way that gives students context behind the basic music theory principles, and provides students with opportunities to experiment with these principles and create creative compositions. This was a very enjoyable quarter, and I look forward to my next."
,,,,,,,,,,,Dr. P is an amazing instructor. She knows what she is talking about and can teach in an effective style. Content is not too hard and tests are generally easy.

,,,,,,,,,,,"Solid music theory course, great teacher, you are essentially forced to learn the material via the skill checks and homeworks (which is a good thing)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great course to get a glance into function music theory concepts. After finishing the course, I was using many of the concepts in my own personal practicing and it was extremely helpful."

The pace is very slow. Mastery of the content could be obtained in a much shorter timeframe, as most of the class time is used for review of concepts and analysis of examples. The theory learned is based on the harmonic style of 18th–century European musicians, which is great if that's what you're interested in, but personally I would prefer a broader scope."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Wong is the best! He is so funny, engaging and understanding. He expects a lot out of you and will push you hard if he thinks you are capable, but he's never not approachable or not willing to help."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good class; Lam Wong is a good theory teacher. However, Theory II as a class was a little confusing due to the fact that the different Units felt disconnected. The material that we go over in class sometimes over complicated what we were actually supposed to be learning."

I don't think I will ever find myself in a situation in which having learned the Rule of the Octave will be useful. Also, I would love to focus on more music that isn't by dead white dudes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Honors Theory is definitely a lot more work than regular theory, but Dr. Kumpf is a great lecturer and super passionate about the topic. He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to learn."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you enjoyed honors theory in the fall, you'll probably enjoy it in the winter too – I love how we go in–depth about the ""why"" of everything, and discussions are always so interesting and engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Music theory continues to be more complex analyses of music, this quarter from a perspective of chords and binary form pieces. Prof. Kumpf is always great, he continues to have fantastic energy and engages the class very well. At times there was a lot of work due on just a certain weekend, and the workload overall feels pretty high, but the material continues to be enjoyable."
bien,music,111,spring,Kenn Kumpf,4.80,4.80,5.00,5.00,5.00,6.20,"Dr. Kumpf is fantastic and very energetic, and cares a lot about the material, which is great for an intro class like theory. Honors was a lot of work this quarter though and ranked nearly the top of my class list in terms of amount of work, despite being only a half credit (they claim it's the same as the regular session but it's definitely a lot more). Class sessions were quite fun (despite being 9 am), but this class did feel frustrating in terms of the amount of outside work."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I truly loved this course. The work load was definitely more than an average .5 class, and prof knows that (and is so understanding about extensions/ the most important part of the assignment), but for people that want to learn more about Music theory, and have a genuine interest to do a deep dive in certain areas, I would highly recommend. Also, Prof is awesome and really intelligent/sharp and loves to nerd out about niche Music Theory concepts and applications – if that's also your thing, class will often be fun."

,,,,,,,,,,,This class was frustrating and difficult. It is a skill that some students come in already being good at or student come with little to no knowledge or training in the subject. This makes the class aggravating because the only way to really practice is repetition and that can become very tedious.
,,,,,,,,,,,Good course. Just make sure to actually practice. I really enjoyed the laid–back nature of the class. It more functions as a guideline to improving your aural skills.

,,,,,,,,,,,"I hate singing in front of others, but vincent made the class environment really comfortable and I felt more and more confident singing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was very effective in laying the groundwork for aural skills, my professor did a good job of balancing the teaching new continent with giving ample opportunities to practice the old ones during class. Pacing and it’s the final project could be a lot better though, we definitely did not have as much time as we needed mostly due to thanksgiving."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a good introduction to solfege and ear training skills. The concepts were fairly easy for me, but the course progressed at a rate that it facilitated growth in all students. I liked how the class was fairly small, with 10–12 students, and how it was a collaborative environment in class."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is very demanding and moves quickly but if you spend time out of class practicing the concepts you are taught you should have no problem with the course.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I absolutely despised Aural prior to this class. After this class, I still don't like it but I enjoyed improving my skills on it. The course moves fairly quick, and the units alternate in terms of difficultly. A lot of the class is dependent on individual practice, which is self–driven. It was hard for me to motivate myself to practice something I was bad at and also did not like. Despite that, it is clear that practice is the only way you can improve. For most part, the listening part of this class was fine. Of course, there were challenges but these were easier to get over than the singing portion. The course mainly focused on melodic dictation, and sight–singing and singing intervals. As long as you practice daily, you will get better even if you don't feel like you are."
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof. Ip is really nice and down to earth. He is the best aural teacher out there and he is quite lenient too. He understands how difficult this class can be and he always finds tricks or tips to help us.

Dr. Kumpf was a good instructor but sometimes not the most understanding in individual assessments. The course material was fine and the software provided to practice was helpful.
,,,,,,,,,,,"One of my easiest classes, I didn't practice outside class til the later weeks when some concepts I had less practice were incorporated more. That's definitely not universal though because the difficulty level just depends how much of a background you have in sight reading and solfege. The practice and ear training is good for all levels though because it doesn't hurt to keep drilling intervals and practice sightreading, that's how your ear gets better. Kumpf is pretty cheerful and he picks out fun songs for us to practice transcribing. Only thing I'd say is if you have to be absent or late take care of that ahead of time otherwise he may be a little to trick to work with on your situation."

Instead of introducing new material, it was more doing more complex things of the same thing. It was also really nice to see theory tie into this quarter's material as well. We started harmonic dictation this quarter which was the really only ""new"" thing. Other than that, the course was pretty much the same if not a bit easier after the foundation was built in fall quarter. Practicing everyday will help greatly."

It is unfortunate that this is a required class for a music major, as much more could be covered in a similar timespan, which could help my musical development and interest tremendously. I was unable to obtain a meaningful answer on why we are required to learn the rhythmic syllable system for dictating 6/8 time, which is not difficult to learn, but feels like time that could be put to use on hearing more difficult rhythms, i.e. ties, that were completely omitted from tests. The skills required to succeed in the class could be learned in a week or two's time of intentional individual practice coupled with an informative lecture style, given that the people in the class are already musicians."

Being a beginning level class I expected to be taught the basics and start from the beginning of how to actually play piano but I felt that this was not the case. In the first weeks we were transposing pieces into different keys and moving our hands all over the keyboard without having much instruction on how to do so properly. I felt that much of my learning that took place for this course was independent. I did appreciate that our pieces we were to prepare were given to us with plenty of time to get them to a presentable condition.

bien,music,211,fall,Noah Jenkins,4.89,3.44,4.22,4.11,4.44,5.66,i didn’t learn much if anything.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Noah is an interesting lecturer. He teaches great but sometimes he always lets everyone get their thoughts in, which would lead to a wasted class where nothing was learned; rather we spent the whole time going over homework. I also dislike that Reinhart controls so much of the curriculum and doesn't allow for discussion and argument within assignments. The class is also definitely a step up from the first year. The assigned readings are also so redundant since we go over them in class there's not a reason to read them in the first place if I'm going to learn about it anyway."
,,,,,,,,,,,"We were not allowed to use iPads in this class, and this became a barrier to effective learning. My teacher was allowed to use an iPad, and clearly they saw that there was a great benefit to being able to use different colors to annotate and analyze excerpts. It is so helpful to be able to put color on our page (especially in fugues!) and be able to erase them if we were wrong. There were times when the teacher would analyze a piece in our textbook, but all we could do was stare at the board. Any notes I took were not helpful when I looked back to them, because they said ""Bar 6 V65"", for example, and I had to REannotate the excerpt when I got home – a waste of my time. It feels like Reinhart does not trust us, and thinks we are highschoolers. No, we pay a lot to attend this institution and we LOVE music, so are enthusiastic to learn and be in this class. Since this is the case, we know that goofing off on our iPads is a waste of our time. If you insist on having the iPad rule, it would be more helpful if it was on the lines of ""you're allowed to have your iPad out, but once I catch you distracted, then no more iPad for the rest of the quarter."" Additionally, I think theory is a very subjective thing. There have been times when I am thinking about what the ""right"" answer is, and less about what I personally hear. I don't think this is what analyzing music is supposed to be like. If we can give reasonable arguments for why we think what we think, then we should be rewarded for that, because it shows we KNOW the material, but happen to have a different opinion from the person who makes the answer sheet! I personally LOVED the classes when we got to discuss why something didn't fit into a certain form, but I would appreciate if we had clear examples that lined up with what we read in the textbook, before getting into anything funky. Also, our teachers never know about what is happening in the class beyond a week, and when the exam suddenly comes, the content on the exam is a surprise to everyone, including our teacher. Curriculum director should be making everything known to the teacher (and students!), so that the teacher can plan out a way to lead us to the exam. I am scoring highly in this class, despite these concerns, but I feel that I could reach my score with less stress and time spent, if these issues were dealt with."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was awful. I really never criticize my classes in CTECs, but this class has genuinely been the worst experience of mine at Northwestern. Prof Reinhart is quite frankly ridiculous. First of all, he bans the use of iPads for note taking in class. I bought an iPad specifically for music classes because it is easier to have all of my notes in the same place. All of the professors (except for Reinhart) use iPads in class to teach us, which I find to be very hypocritical and obnoxious. Then we get into the exams. Reinhart doesn't provide study guides to us until 48 hours before the exam. Seeing that there is a ton of material covered on each exam, I find this to be really sabotaging to everyone. We also get pop quizzes that VERY heavily impact our grades. I'm not talking pop quizzes on material that we have been learning for weeks, but material that we have quite literally never studied beyond 1 class period. It is ridiculous how they grade things in this class. I also take major offense to the fact that we do not have the Wednesday before Thanksgiving off. I received an unexcused absence even after I offered to zoom in (which all of my teachers allowed me to do). Overall, I think that Professor Reinhart runs this program really poorly. He hasn't responded to any of my (or my peers') emails about all of these things, which is why this CTEC is so harsh, but do not take this year of music theory if you don't have to, and DO NOT take the section with Robert Reinhart."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class often times did not feel very structured. Although I think it is nice to have PhD students teaching the classes, I feel as though some of them are not trained well enough to teach course material effectively. Material learned in class was applicable to the music I play, but some of the details we learn seem a bit redundant."
bien,music,211,fall,Alissa Voth,3.50,3.00,3.88,4.13,2.88,7.50,I absolutely did not like this class. This is more personal but I do not like theory but I found first year theory extremely useful and grounded. I very much did not find anything I learnt this quarter useful. I think the assignments are given vague instructions most times. There are different fundamental instructions from each of the teaching assistants which makes understanding the requirements for assignment confusing. I had peers who had different understanding of the same concept and I found that lack of consistency around the board of teachers really annoying. I very much liked my Professor and felt she facilitated the classes well. I especially liked her explanations of concepts because I always understood them in class. I just personally do not like the Reinhart's course and I personally think second year theory should not be required by the music school for performance degree.
,,,,,,,,,,,We never knew what was going to be taught next and so it didn’t feel like the course had a direction. We also didn’t get the study guides until the class before the midterm which was very unhelpful.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course frustrated me. Time was managed poorly, questions regarding material were almost discouraged, we never got substantial/detailed enough feedback on many homework assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Alissa is such a nice person, but her class was extremely unorganized. Many times, it felt as if she herself was unclear on the material that she was supposed to be teaching us; she regularly defaulted to ""talk to me after class"" or ""send me an email"" whenever a challenging question came up rather than taking time to address it to benefit the class, and class time was largely spent unproductively. Her lectures were not very focused or structured, and I felt as if I learned more from the class subs (who had slides and tangible lesson plans) in a day than from her own lectures in a week. This, combined with frustrating department policies (i.e. little to no access to study materials/basic information about exams up until two days before), made it hard to know what information covered in or outside of class was valuable or not. Again, Alissa was very nice and expressed willingness to help, but her teaching style did not work for me, unfortunately."
,,,,,,,,,,,"very messy course, definitions concerning fugue and sonata terms were especially inconsistent, i understand that sometimes these terms are up to debate, but other times, they straight up did not make any sense in the context of the pieces that we were given. one example being the labelling of where the transition was in a piece. the entire class got it wrong, we all had different answers, a new made up term ""transition–esque"" was used to describe the section instead, and was all just generally confusing. i am disappointed in the overall structure of the class. i feel that the terms we learned should have been pretty straight forward, but there were too many inconsistencies that were poorly explained."
bien,music,211,fall,Tomas Gueglio Saccone,4.50,3.00,3.25,2.75,4.75,6.00,"I think there is certainly value in learning the different forms of music but the examples were frustratingly not helpful. For example, when we just learned certain forms and labels for sonatas we would get so many ambiguous examples to analyze that it ended up more confusing. The textbook also made things sound more confusing than it should be and they really should upload some form of notes that we could look over."
bien,music,211,fall,Robert Reinhart,4.71,4.43,5.14,5.86,4.57,7.50,Reinhart is a great professor. Grades slightly on the harsher side but definitely a wonderful and entertaining lecturer. This was the most insightful theory class in the sequence so far.
,,,,,,,,,,,very different from theory 111. Not sure if anything taught in the class is concrete or if it is all made up by Dr. Reinhart.
,,,,,,,,,,,"In general, the topics we cover are pretty interesting, but there are some subjects that we spend weeks on that seem pretty straightforward and perhaps the time would be better spent covering other things. Dr. Reinhart has pretty rigid expectations that don't always seem clear and he's a pretty strict grader. Assignments can be pretty tedious/challenging and hard to complete individually. Some days we have assignments that take hours and other days we have assignments that take 20 minutes. To do really well in this class you may need to do some extra practice/research/studying. There are pop quizzes that are always scary!"
bien,music,211,fall,Noah Jenkins,3.86,3.57,3.43,3.57,3.71,5.86,"This is a great course. Noah is a great instructor who emphasises discussion over lecture, and is always open to new ideas that may or may not align with the ""facts"" we learned. He, as did all of us, seemed to enjoy the fact that music theory is really trying to put objective labels into what is often purely subjective."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The curriculum is poorly thought out and many of the examples and grading of the homework are very harsh for subjective matters. Many of the TAs do not seem to know what Dr. Reinhart is looking for and it makes it difficult to go through homework or examples sometimes. Also, many practice materials are often delayed until right before the final or midterm. So much of the class is putting a definitive label on subjective material and it often gets very frustrating."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course can be very helpful, but the instruction varies significantly between professors. I know students that learned a lot and others that were consistently dismayed by their professor’s lack of effectiveness compared to other instructors. I also found the no–late homework policy odd. I have never had a class that didn’t have at least some accommodation, and this rule only made sense for those assignments that were covered in class on the due date. This rule seemed to encouraged some of my peers to cheat because they couldn’t hand in homework for a late penalty. Even day–of late allowances for some assignments would be just fine. Sometimes just a little bit of extra time is all that is necessary. The handling of homework could have also been better. There was no hard rule about turning in assignments on Canvas vs. in–person (only that in–person was preferred). This was problematic though because sometimes the professor would want one over the other. This meant that the canvas assignment would look late even though everyone was informed when they arrived to class on the due date."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The ""teaching style"" of this class sets students up for failure. Never once has it felt like my instructor had a clear lesson plan before class. We complete homework assignments on our own time and proceed to spent the majority (usually 40 mins out of the 50 min period) of class redoing the homework with the professor. Then, in the last 10 minutes of class, we essentially flip through the content we were supposed to learn that day. Furthermore, the evaluation method is ridiculous: our in class quizzes consistently test us on material that is completely irrelevant and never even mentioned before or after the quiz (ie double fugue). Given the rigid deadlines for students, instructors should also have a deadline for grading; currently, one day before grades are due, half of our homework assignments and our final exam are still not graded. If Bienen cares about retaining, not even supporting, its student, it should really take a look at why students are having to drop their performance majors, or their music degrees entirely, because of this class – a class that should be making students more excited about music."
,,,,,,,,,,,"While many concepts in this class are introduced well and taught solidly, the design of the class is contradictory to its nature, which makes it an overall frustrating experience. Dr. Jenkins will give a broad overview of a new topic, but then every example of this concept will be something that goes against the rules we just learned, making it hard to solidify these concepts. Conceptually, I find it really cool to look at exceptions to the rule, but the class is not designed in a way that facilitates discussion of these exceptions. Unlike last year, which used apps like Miro to assign homework, everything is on paper, leaving little room to explain our decisions regarding these tough examples. When we go over the examples in class, it is less an exploration of the exception and ways to analyze it, and more of a lecture that tells us that there is one correct way to interpret this example that doesn't follow the rules, which, in my eyes, dives too deep into the pedantic nature of music theory. Essentially, it feels like we are being thrown into a blender with the intention of ripping us up and confusing us, instead of encouraging us to explore and debate. I find music theory to be fascinating, and it is frustrating to see it taught in such a ""gotcha"" fashion."
bien,music,211,fall,Sara Bowden,6.00,4.90,5.20,5.10,6.00,8.60,"Sara is a godsend. They took a challenging, inflexibly structured course and manage to make it fun and interesting. The course itself is definitely harder than first year theory, but as long as you pay attention and ask questions, it's totally manageable. If you have the chance, take this class (or any class) with Sara!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Sara was the only reason I didn't drop this one. Poorly organized, lackluster content and consistently low–quality recordings used as critical materials made everything suck way more than it had to. If they'd branch out and work in some more popular areas and/or modern works + absolutely dispose of and and all memorizing of repertoire and information about it, perhaps the course could move back in the right direction."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm a freshmen that was placed into this class. I took AP Theory prior to this, although I don't think that helped me too much. It is definitely helpful to have a strong background in chord analysis, and being able to do it quick. Doing Roman Numeral analysis quickly is super useful and will be one of the most valuable things for you in this class. I've always been interested in theory, so I really looked forward to coming to this class every time. The first quarter was a lot of stuff I had already learned, so it was quite easy for me. This course covers phrase types, binary forms, ternary forms, fugues, and sonata forms. Even though we learned rules and certain things that were found in these topics, a lot of times these rules are broken. It can be kind of frustrating at times since the answer is not clear cut. Luckily, the class is quite heavily based on discussion and a lot of times, there are multiple answers if it can be argued well. It was nice to hear about other's thoughts, and I learned most from hearing how other people came to the answer they came to. The midterm is relatively easy, and it helps that there is a review sheet and a lot of extra practices online too. The final is also relatively easy and there is also an optional final project that if done right will raise your letter grade (B becomes B+, A– becomes A etc.) There are pop quizzes from time to time but they are generally simple and will not ask you to analyze anything, but more about defintions."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Ms. Bowden is a great teacher and she understands the same frustration we have with figuring out the answers. She's also really lenient with submitting homework and accuracy. A lot of homework is based off completion. She is a great listener and will always hear different arguments and tell us why our argument works or doesn't. She also is engaged in our discussions, and when we are discussing with our peers, she will walk around and answer any questions, check our work, ask follow up questions, or just join the discussion."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Sara Bowden is an incredible teacher. This class is pretty hard at times and they are so good at helping students understand. The curriculum and the music theory department is sometimes disorganized and it seems to students like we don't really know what to expect from the class. In those times of confusion, I felt like Sara was really helpful. In addition to this, Sara was very friendly and relatable, which gave the class a great dynamic."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's a required course, so you're probably registered for this class already. If Sara Bowden is still teaching theory, GET THEM AT ALL COSTS. As long as you pay attention in class and do the homework, you'll be fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really loved this course. It was so interesting to see how the material we discussed in the beginning of the class, phrasing and structure of music, snowballed and developed into concepts like sonata form and fugues."
bien,music,211,winter,Noah Jenkins,5.50,4.14,4.29,4.14,5.88,6.44,"Noah is a really nice teacher! I've had him for two quarters this far and I'm hoping to have him again next quarter. He's really reasonable with homework/grading relatively speaking, and is always really responsive when I ask him for help. In particular I appreciate how he's always in a good mood coming into class. In terms of the actual curriculum, this quarter was disappointing. The midterm especially focused primarily on memorizing details and nitpicky bits of information rather than the topics and frameworks we learned. It was also extremely repetitive because every lecture was just to go over the homework. As literally everyone in the past have already commented on previous CTECs, it's still extremely annoying that electronics are banned and the review sheet is given only two days before the tests. PLEASE FIX THIS IT IS VERY HYPOCRITICAL AND FRUSTRATING."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I hope there will be no comments complaining about the fact that we aren't allowed to use tablets in class like for last quarter's course. For those who have taken a core music course that allows electronics, you should need no introduction to the fact that many people will just do whatever they please on their devices during class. I've seen people writing essays to playing games to working on photoshop designs to scrolling on Twitter in other music classes.. I can't begin to tell you how annoying it is to focus when people in front of you do this. This class at least gets people to focus on the material in front of them. A lot of people don't seem to enjoy being in the class to begin with, so the no–electronics policy seems to help them stay focused and attentive."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Second year Music theory is pretty useless, with ridiculous pop quizzes, poor time duration for exams and lack of a trajectory. Seems we are just learning whatever Reinhart deems important to cover in his module for the class. Noah is great and definitely makes the class bearable. Take with Noah if you can."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Jenkins is a very good teacher of this course. He was very effective at communicating the topics we were learning in class. But there are some issues with the general curriculum. The listening identification aspects of the class did not appear to have any music–theory related purpose, besides testing one's memorization skills."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Noah is very sweet and approachable to ask for help. However most of our frustrations of the class are focused on the curriculum organizer Dr. Reinhart. The style of curriculum is extremely counterproductive especially in the beginning. No notes on Canvas, had pop quizzes, and in class we would spend more time discussing than actually learning topics. I feel that there was also not much incentive to stay in class since most of the time it was spent going over homework instead of learning and refreshing concepts."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Noah improved a lot this quarter compared to the Fall. We no longer spent 45 minutes in class on going over the homework, and it felt like each class had structure and was thoroughly planned out. Content wise, I feel like the pieces we learned about in class related to the topics we were going over. However, the listening portions on the midterm and final feel a little redundant. Although I did well on those questions, I don't think it doesn't really have any real–world applications other than a gotcha moment for students in case they weren't paying attention in class. Realistically speaking my future employer is not going to be like ""identify what movement this ideé fixe from Berlioz Symphony Fantastique is from or you'll never get a raise."""
bien,music,211,winter,Robert Reinhart,5.50,5.20,5.33,5.50,5.33,7.01,"Dr. Reinhart is a good lecturer and is invested in helping students learn. He is very receptive when fielding questions from students. However, occasionally his grading appeared to be arbitrary. If you are particularly interested in/a fan of music theory, I would encourage you to take music theory with Dr. Reinhart. For people just looking meet the distro requirement, this course might be a little more challenging."
bien,music,211,winter,Sara Bowden,5.88,3.75,4.88,5.25,6.00,7.50,"This class can be hard, but Sara was super helpful and a great teacher overall. They went out of their way to help us and to have open discussions about the shortcomings of the curriculum (of which there are several). Considering they're not allowed to design (or even alter) the content of this course, they were a great instructor, and were always willing to help me in office hours or over email with course questions, letters of rec, or anything else that would come up."
,,,,,,,,,,,It's a well–prepared course but can be quite rigid in its ways
,,,,,,,,,,,I love Sara. At times they are a little fast–paced but they're so chill and welcoming and understanding when you go to office hours. They're also a super fair and forgiving grader. They are super funny too! Reasonable assignments but the course material could definitely be more inclusive and at times less redundant. Some subjects felt like we spent too much time and some too little. We don't have enough time on the tests and the different sections are often weighted kind of iffy.
,,,,,,,,,,,We didn't get study guides for midterm/ final until 2 days before the exam
,,,,,,,,,,,They made us wait to get our study guide and the tests were not structured well.
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THEORY WITH SARA! Even though they were operating on a rather disjointed curriculum and some frustrating department policies designed by Professor Reinhart, Sara still managed to keep class fun and engaging and explained content clearly and effectively. This is at no fault to Sara, but I believe (and I'm willing to bet that most of my classmates would agree) that Reinhart's second–year theory curriculum needs to be reassessed. I find the material that is emphasized in this curriculum to be impractical, and I was hoping to learn things that are a little more applicable. I also think Reinhart's tendency to keep exam information under wraps until the class prior is unfair and illogical. That being said, if Sara continues teaching theory in the future, definitely try to get into their section! They're easily the most informative and personable TA in this year's theory sequence."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was tough. Not only is Professor Reinhardt a harsh overall grader, but he has a strange way of structuring the class material. Namely that the exams are 100x harder than the actual coursework we do in class, and that we don't get the study guide for exams until a class before. There is a ton of material on each exam and because we get the study guide only one class period before, people have a hard time doing well on the exams. If you have to tale this class take it with Sara. They are AMAZING and are so helpful with everything theory related. My gripe is not with the way material was taught (Because Sara was genuinely the best theory teacher I have had), but with the way it is structured by Prof Reinhardt. I also think that the 2 class max for absences is ridiculous. Life happens and sometimes you have to miss a class for something that apparently isn't an excusable reason. Because of this your grade gets docked a ton of points. Overall, my least favorite section of music theory due to structure of the material."
bien,music,211,winter,Tomas Gueglio Saccone,5.89,4.67,4.89,4.86,5.89,8.44,Tomas is the best! Definitely recommend taking theory with him. He's very open to listening to all our interpretations of analyzing pieces.

bien,music,211,winter,Robert Reinhart,4.00,3.50,4.25,4.75,3.75,11.00,"I can from another teacher (a grad student's) theory class and I loved fall quarter theory. It was so fun and the concepts weren't too challenging and theory was one of my favorite classes and one of my highest grade. That changed a lot this quarter. Right from the start, we started learning new material right away. This was fine but it was just incredibly fast paced and only about half the class was used to actually teach what it was and the rest of the class would be looking at examples where it broke the rules of what we just learned or is a modification of what it is supposed to be. Of course, that is the nature of music which I completely understand but also it was not a great way to learn the concept as your understanding of the concept wasn't that good. Prof. Reinhart is a very passionate and invested professor, but that comes in the way a lot. He's a composer, so he definitely has the background and knowledge for this class. However, I think he tends to think that we also have as much intelligence and knowledge to him. When he explains things to us, it always sounds like he's reviewing concepts instead of teaching something new. Whenever there are questions, he answers them so fast that no one really has time to process what the question is or what he says. Of course, he's always right with what he says, but it just moves too fast. He's also an incredibly harsh grader. I was stunned to see theory, which was my highest grade in fall quarter, become my lowest grade this quarter. Not to be offensive or anything, but he does not seem open or like to different opinions. Whenever someone offers another interpretation, he does not think too much into them even if they have good reasoning. I get there are some boundaries with music, but a lot of times, there are different interpretations and when backed by good evidence, I think it should be heard. I'm not the one to usually argue with the professor but there were times where I really wanted to raise my hand and ask why we could not look more into one of the interpretations that almost the entire class wrote down. Overall, I would say buckle down for a more intense quarter and to be able to keep up with the fast pace. There is a lot more analysis in this class thna in last quarter."
bien,music,211,winter,Noah Jenkins,5.40,3.80,4.80,4.80,5.00,6.20,"First of all, I think that Noah did an overall good job. He was super understanding towards the class and explained things effectively."
,,,,,,,,,,,"My issue lies a lot more with the design of this class, for which I don't think Noah is really responsible for. The content itself is pretty manageable, it's not super easy but it's also not insanely difficult or complicated. But we are asked master the material in a way that is unreasonable IMO. We only got the practice sheet for the exam 48 hours in advance, and the sheet itself was honestly pretty minimal. We got very limited practice problems as well (though Noah was considerate enough to come up with a few himself before the final). Despite this, the exams were really challenging. The average on our midterm was a 74!!! Some people in our class did better in ORGO(!!) than they did in this class, which is honestly insane considering this is a half credit, required music class. I understand that Reinhart wants us to have a really solid understanding of the material, but I also think this means that the teachers themselves need to rethink how they can better teach us that material. I think the exam results for this class prove that what they're doing right now isn't enough."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class design is also really old school. We aren't allowed to use technology in class – I understand that Reinhart wants us to be focused in class, but I think it's also important to acknowledge that technology really helps a lot of students better learn the material. I'm honestly surprised that this isn't an ANU violation."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This quarter's material was better organized than the fall quarter. I think having more group projects is quite fun, and it actually allows us to use and experience the material ourselves. It seems like the TAs had a little more autonomy over how they directed their respective classes, so that seems like an improvement from last quarter."

,,,,,,,,,,,"I think that the data was very useful, although abstract. However, I don't agree with the concept of coming up with more concrete answers when all of the concepts and pieces are up for interpretation"
bien,music,211,spring,Noah Jenkins,4.75,3.13,3.00,2.50,3.71,5.00,"After having a fantastic experience in Advanced Music Theory last year, I had high hopes for the second–year sequence this year, and this has unfortunately led to an overall sense of disappointment. There were a few high points – the rep chosen by Dr. Reinhart was interesting and engaging, for one, and many of the pieces did well to communicate the concepts they were meant to teach. Despite these positives, the structure of the course, especially this quarter, deflated any remaining excitement for music theory that I started with going into this year. Homework worksheets tended to ask leading questions with only one sanctioned answer, discouraging creativity and critical analysis in favor of more straightforward guidance. In–class discussions were largely spent going over these worksheets rather than expanding on what we learned, which made most classes feel like repeats of the homework and wastes of time. Because of this, the many topics we covered, especially when we moved away from more traditional tonal systems, felt like the surface was barely scratched, with holes in our understanding of the concepts. With the quarter system, it is understandable that the course is a ""mile wide and an inch deep,"" but the problem arises when on exams, we are expected to have a deeper understanding of the course topics than what we were provided. This is likely due to a combination of Dr. Reinhart's curriculum and Dr. Jenkins' instruction. Speaking of exams, the increased emphasis on memorization of the pieces we studied takes the course in a direction that I and many others disagree with: rather than build up our ability to efficiently and effectively analyze pieces using our experiences from this class, this quarter of music theory seemed to want us only to look backward, regurgitating the ""Reinhart–approved"" interpretations of the music we already covered. While this ideology may work for other lecture–based classes, this exam style diminishes the usefulness of music theory for our performances and compositions, especially compared to the first year of theory."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Noah is great the only complaint is mainly on the course department organizing. It felt like in class there wasn't much material taught, it was usually just thrown at you and you were expected to figure out. Also rough since the class doesn't have lecture notes and the homework assignments were even attached in canvas."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The teaching ""assistants"" who help teach the class sections aren’t to blame for the student’s generally strong dislike of the class, but rather the curriculum designed by Dr. Robert Reinhart, which the TAs are told to teach strictly from without deviation. This curriculum has many issues within it: 1) Homework worksheets are handed out in person during class, but if the instructor forgets to print it out or the student misses class, the worksheets are not posted online, rather, the students usually have to go out of their way to retrieve it from the office at 4th floor RCMA on their own time. Given that less than 2 days are given in between each homework being due and that students already have their own busy class and work schedules to deal with, this is extremely inconvenient for many students, most of whom are accustomed to homework worksheets for other classes being posted on Canvas (as is the norm throughout the entire university EXCEPT for this class). 2) Unlike the rest of the university, there are no teaching materials posted on Canvas. No PowerPoints, no regular supplementary readings, no textbooks/articles corresponding to the classes, nada. The classes themselves are not very structured. One class, we had a very excellent substitute teacher come in, who had created his own PowerPoint based off of Dr. Reinhart’s suggested topic, but with material covered to a depth and structure that we had never before experienced. I’m pretty sure that substitute did his own research and went outside of Dr. R’s provided curriculum to create the PowerPoint. That was one of the best classes we ever had, where it actually felt like we learned things and it was easy to follow along with the class material. 3) Reinhart waits exactly two school days before each exam to provide a guide on what each exam will be covering. Usually, this takes place in the middle of the week, when students are already struggling with practicing, other midterms, homework, projects, exams, and part–time jobs. Reinhart treats us like this is the only class we have to study for and, quite frankly, is IMMENSELY disrespectful of our time and us as human beings. We tried to appeal to him in an email to send out the guide earlier, because it’s vital for people to study for an exam that they know exactly what is on the exam (especially because there’s no teaching materials on Canvas, as aforementioned), but he turned us down harshly, saying that if we needed to know what was on the exam so badly, we should have taken better notes and paid more attention during class time. WELL, Dr. Reinhart, if you wanted us to take better notes during class, maybe you should have created a class structure/curriculum that actually TAUGHT us things EFFICIENTLY AND CONCISELY instead of making us spend most of our time struggling through homework that we barely understand and then wasting class time attempting to piece together content from the homework that didn’t MAKE SENSE. 4) A significant part of exams test us on rote memorization of pieces by ear and concepts that the pieces employed. What, I ask, is the point of rote memorization? I thought Music Theory was supposed to teach you analytical and critical thinking skills, no? So why are we being tested on memorization and not more of that? 5) Why are electronics banned in class? I understand that you want us to stay focused during class, but we’re ADULTS capable of making our own choices about how we best concentrate and take notes during class. Many of us don’t take paper notes in our other classes, but rely instead on digital tablets and typing notes on documents via our laptops. When you deprive us of the methods we take notes best through, you are limiting our ability to absorb information and learn. 6) Also, the course packets and worksheets are extremely heavy! Many of my friends and I have back pain and posture issues throughout the year because of the amount of stuff we have to lug all over campus already and all the time we need to spend studying and practicing. The binder and course packet is not helping– in fact, it’s making it worse! And paper class materials are antiquated and outdated at this point in the age of technology. Get with the times and needs of your students, please, Dr. Reinhart."
,,,,,,,,,,,Interesting topics but somewhat random/unconnected feeling compared to the previous theory courses.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think this quarter's music theory made me dislike modern music, when before I was more neutral towards it. As always, everything is done on paper, which is very annoying and frustrating. I think most of the concepts we covered in class were extremely useless. In particular, I hated the normal/prime form, the 12 tone matrices, and composition project. The curriculum is just so boring and useless and it was a struggle to go to class, except I had to go because attendance is required :/"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really liked Noah as a teacher. The classes where he brings in his viola to showcase his interests inside the curriculum saved me. I also think that he is a fair grader (all things considered with Reinhart's curriculum) and shows respect to students. Considering that most of the student body becomes slightly aggressive to him due to feeling frustrated and angry at the curriculum, I think he handled everything well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The curriculum of this course felt frustratingly disjunct. I understand that covering the past 100 or so years of musical development in detail is difficult to accomplish in just one quarter. I don't envy the position of creating a curriculum to effectively teach that much content. But that being said, I don't believe the current system is effective."
,,,,,,,,,,,"One of the main reasons for this is a lack of through–lines presented by the course. We started with modal music, then jumped immediately to twelve tone serialism, later moving to John Cage, minimalism, and more. I never felt that we really learned how to analyze any of these styles in any significant detail. We just learned that they existed and how to identify them. They felt so disjunct from each other that it became difficult to keep track of how we moved from one style to another or how they were relevant to each other. If the goal of this class is to provide a brief look at each of these styles (which is frustrating to me in the context of a music theory class where I am hoping to learn analysis), then it would be nice to provide more historical context that ties these styles together. There were brief glimpses into the histories, but they never felt fully effective or fleshed out enough to really solidify my understanding."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would have much preferred to have picked a select few styles and really go into detail about how to approach analyzing them, taking time to sample multiple works across different composers so we can see the patterns that develop within a style and really get to solidify our ideas on how a certain style works. I promise you that in a year I will have forgotten entirely what the spectralism movement is, because we only spent one class on it, examining one piece. I'd feel much more comfortable in my analytical skills if we could have spent that class talking in more detail about minimalism or another style in order to deepen our understanding. As we skimmed the surface of different musical styles, we often talked about the ‘what’, but rarely the ‘why’."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Maybe one of the reasons I struggled so much to hold onto knowledge throughout this course is the frustrating lack of student support from the course coordinator, Robert Reinhart. The Canvas page is barren– no homework answers (or even blank homework pages), notes, study guides, etc, are ever posted. This makes studying for exams (which include a strange amount of arbitrary memorization for what is supposedly a class in analysis) incredibly difficult. When students organized and asked for access to a study guide earlier than two days before the final exam, we were told no. We were told to review our notes from class. But with a class with material as disjunct as this is, it is really helpful to have a guide to refresh our memories and help walk us through what we are expected to know. Especially when terms that we might’ve only heard once two months ago might show up on the exam. If there were literally any materials available to students on Canvas then this problem would be significantly mitigated."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I will say, however, I really appreciated the efforts of our teacher, Noah Jenkins. Aside from making an effort to make himself available to students who requested help, he went out of his way to collect extra materials for us to either look at on our own or discuss in class. I particularly liked when he brought in academic writings relevant to the pieces/stylistic movements we were discussing in class, because it helped me connect all the terms and ideas we were learning to actual analysis. It helped elevate the course from just identification to critical thinking, which is a shift desperately needed."
bien,music,211,spring,Tomas Gueglio Saccone,5.75,4.63,4.88,4.88,5.75,9.50,So much work for a 0.5 credit class.. should be 1 credit in my opinion
,,,,,,,,,,,Take notes– literally write everything on the slides down!! The slides are never posted and you're not allowed to take pictures of the slides at all.
,,,,,,,,,,,"High course load. Midterms and final much less challenging than Theory V, but contemporary music much more challenging to conceptually understand, so homework took much more time."
,,,,,,,,,,,"tomas is an amazing instructor, you learn a lot from this class but always in an easily digestible manner, he always comes in prepared with slides so concepts are easy to learn and understand, he is amazing and beyond well versed in theory knowledge with confidence and skill/hard work to back it up, at the same time he is humble too, if anyone ever points out a different perspective, he takes this in stride. has randi a random name picker, but not stressful at all, if you are chosen he is very open to whatever you have to say even if it is very little or reaching for something. always there to help student in office hours. amazing instructor, i had a lot of fun in this class!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Tomas is the absolute best, and I fully recommend taking theory with him. Makes the class truly engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved how many topics this class covered, while still paying enough attention to each one to provide a thorough understanding over a broad spectrum. I personally love contemporary classical music, and appreciate the method it was taught."
bien,music,211,spring,Noah Jenkins,5.80,4.90,5.00,5.10,5.50,5.80,"I could spend all day describing how much I dislike this class and Reinhart's structure for it but at this point it's already over. I did not learn anything useful this quarter and found assignments to be a complete waste of time. However, I must absolutely appreciate the greatest Music Theory Teacher of all Time – Dr Noah Jenkins. As much as I hated this class, I loved coming for my 11am section to sit and listen and have an engaging time with Noah. He was passionate, competent and passed his ideas and instructions across effectively. He related to his students and made the class bearable and even fun 90% of the time. If you have to take Second Year Aural or Theory which you probably have to cause I do not know why you would if it wasn't demanded of you, TAKE IT WITH NOAH!!! He's the best, an absolute unit!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Also contrary to most people's opinions, I would argue this is the easiest quarter of second year theory, just do what is required of you, study with friends and spend as little time as possible cause it's not that deep. The final project is honestly just salt to injury cause it is such an unnecessary waste of time and energy, Please stop giving so much work for 0.5 credit class! Good luck to you entering your final quarter of this!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"DEFINITELY take this class with Noah if you can. He's so chill and understanding but also really helpful, and I learned a lot. Seriously I can't recommend him enough. Also, I actually found this quarter of theory to be the easiest this year so far – that might be a hot take though."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Students in this class have asked over and over again for the study guide to be released sooner than 2 days before the test, because it genuinely makes a difference to know more specifically what will be covered and how significant topics are. It's been dismissed over and over again, which is really frustrating because those of us asking really want to succeed and have genuine interest in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Noah is probably the greatest theory teacher. Also just a very easy class :)
bien,music,214,fall,Jesse Rosenberg,4.70,3.95,3.65,3.20,4.20,3.76,"This course was very reliant on the handful of discussion posts and responses, which were loosely related to the lectures but not cohesive. The lectures were very hard to comprehend and take notes on, but they didn't serve much of a purpose since I didn't need any of the material from lectures to complete the assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty good class. However, I feel like I learned very little about actual music history. Sure, we learned about all the biases of the ""classical"" ""canon,"" but I want to learn about the people in the ""canon"" too!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Even after a full quarter, I'm still not entirely clear on the goal of this course. The lectures have little to do with each other or the quizzes/assignments given throughout the quarter. Jesse is an interesting person, but his lectures were very dull and unengaging. Attendance is mandatory, but you won't learn anything; that being said, this class is an easy A."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Rosenberg is great! He really wants everyone to succeed in the class. There were no tests, two very easy quizzes, and a lot of writing assignments. The assignments were related to the class material, and as long as decent time was spent on them, you do well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The instruction material and curriculum of course depends on the instructor, but I found this year excellent. I took this class as the last one of the three. As an introduction to the sequence though for most students, this quarter was a softer introduction and primer for the type of thinking and engagement required in the following 2 classes of the sequence. I was glad that there were not too many listening quizzes because as necessary as they are, they seem to distract somewhat from the more important act of comparing works in assignments. You had to listen to the required works in order to complete assignments, and this was much more meaningful and realistic than memorizing them for a quiz."
,,,,,,,,,,,Follow instructions and hand things in on time and you will be successful in this class!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Rosenberg is a delightful teacher with lots of wisdom. Feels like I developed a mode of thinking, more than just acquired information. Just wish that we moved through materials a little quicker at times."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I appreciate the enormous emphasis on the unfairness of who's in the canon and who's not but if I'm an undergrad taking music history my main priority is the basics of the big main composers, and we didn't get nearly as much of that as I hoped."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is actually two different courses– the things we do in class and the assignments we are given. The two have no overlap. I enjoyed the assignments (although the grading was sometimes arbitrarily harsh), but the class itself was exceedingly boring. The lectures generally had no real direction or content, Rosenberg kinda just... talked. Sometimes it was interesting, but I can't really pinpoint one single thing I actually learned."
,,,,,,,,,,,NA
,,,,,,,,,,,The final essay is kind of out of nowhere. There is no real prompt. Class just kind of drones on every time.
,,,,,,,,,,,I appreciated the larger theme of the course being for us to challenge our notions of canonicity in classical music.
bien,music,214,fall,Jesse Rosenberg,5.11,4.22,3.67,3.78,4.56,4.78,"Interesting class, you learn about music history but also think critically about what the canon is, what is “good” music, etc. lot of other macro–level questions about music"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Rosenberg is a good prof for this class. I don't think I learned a lot about actual music history, but I do know have more of idea about what a canon means. Considering it is a required course, take it with Rosenberg."
,,,,,,,,,,,"this course is an easy A! some written homeworks every week or two, a 10 page final paper at the end but you can write about anything you want. professor is very kind, quietly passionate about music history. laid back and understanding :)"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed Professor Rosenberg –– he was very nice, understanding, and knowledgable. The quizzes weren't difficult and the assignments weren't too bad, which was definitely a plus. Sometimes it felt like we were just randomly hopping from topic to topic (which makes sense in a discussion–based course), but a little more structure would be nice."
bien,music,215,winter,Drew Davies,5.47,5.00,4.73,3.25,4.00,5.07,"Davies is the best professor to do music history with by far. He really cares about this course and the structure is very understandable, and not overly time–consuming. I highly recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Davies is the best. Take this class with Davies if you can over any other musicology professor. He gives very engaging lectures, and is clearly passionate and knowledgable about the subject. Grading consists of 3 papers/projects and 2 exams, but the projects are generously graded and the exams were open note, take home, and multiple choice (you could find 90% of the answers directly on his posted slides)."
,,,,,,,,,,,Would definitely recommend taking this class with Davies. He designs it in a way where the workload os really manageable but at the same time I felt like I was actually learning something. This class honestly proved to be more valuable to my understanding of myself as a musician than I was expecting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall a decent impression of this course. Davies is an engaging lecturer, subject matter is interesting for the most part. Good Canvas discussion prompts, quiz content is fair, readings are pretty lengthy but mostly skimmable if you’re short on time."
,,,,,,,,,,,"My main criticism of this course is the grading of the papers/projects. Aside from some of the projects having somewhat unreasonable demands depending on what instrument you play (e.g. project 1, good luck listing ten notable performers on your instrument if you play anything that’s not a violin, cello, or piano, while only using being able to use academically viable sources), none of this really mattered since it seems like most people were given the same grades anyway on Canvas. For what it’s worth, I even tried sandbagging the final essay to see if that would get me a lower grade, but I still got just as good of a score as the previous two essays. These papers really need to use formal rubrics, otherwise the grading is definitely very arbitrary."
,,,,,,,,,,,"That being said, I did genuinely find many of the topics and concepts introduced in this class to be interesting. In the interests of future students, I hope that the projects and their grading can be fixed for future course iterations."
,,,,,,,,,,,the material was broken up in sections and the powerpoints were helpful. there's two multiple choice tests that u don't have to do in class. three essays thruout the quarter too but they're not that bad.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course covered many different topics, some of which I felt were more interesting than others. In terms of engagement, I think this course was alright, but some topics didn't feel super critical. Projects were fairly unrelated to the course material, and online multiple choice factual tests were fairly easy. I think this was a pretty interesting class, but also pretty easy to skate through if it's not interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Davies is a great instructor and clearly passionate about the course material. The lectures were engaging and touched on a variety of different areas of music to provide a well–rounded history of music performance. The three projects were all relevant to the individual (history of your instrument, your own performance lineage, etc) and provided an opportunity for students to gain insight on their own place in the wider world of performing arts. The course also wasn't unnecessarily hard and instead focused on teaching the material."
,,,,,,,,,,,"A very good course with a great professor who knows what he's talking about. He goes over many interesting topics that are actually quite applicable, and the assignments and quizzes aren't bad at all. Each day is a different topic so it gets a little scattered (my only criticism), but he makes them as related as possible."
,,,,,,,,,,,"You can get away with just skimming the readings and not taking any notes. If you're not at the level of someone who wanted to get into music school for your undergrad while you were in high school, you might learn a lot. If you are already in Bienen, the class might not be challenging at all. But I was not well–versed in finding academic sources and getting the needed info from them, so THAT was the big challenge for me."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Davies's lectures are interesting and well–presented. Course workload is very light, and attendance is not tracked. Grading is not very harsh, so overall this class is pretty straightforward."
bien,music,215,winter,Drew Davies,5.29,4.63,4.06,3.25,4.88,3.50,"This was a great class! The workload was very reasonable, including readings, discussion posts (which most of the time we discussed the topic in class beforehand), a few papers (which I really enjoyed writing, as they were super helpful for learning about and reflecting on my own personal experience as a performer), and an online midterm and final. Prof Davies is very kind, engaging, and his lectures are organized and interesting. You will get out what you put into this class. To make the most of the class, do the readings and go to the lectures. Both are worthwhile!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was really well–structured and it felt very easy to succeed if you put in the work! Prof. Davies is such a sweet guy and you can tell he really loves the material and wants his students to do well. Definitely take this class with him.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really liked how we examined genres of music outside of classical, like EDM, jazz, flamenco, etc.!"
,,,,,,,,,,,DEF take this course with Davies if you can. He is so smart and so chill. This course is a light load.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was quite interesting. I think Prof Davies did a good job connecting all the material to each other –– the lectures and readings all matched up, and I do feel like I've gained new perspective on the music I've played."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I wish I could say something about this class, but alas I never went."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not too much going on here, just be timely with submissions and put in the work!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class felt mostly like busywork. There was hardly any room in discussion posts or papers for critical thinking; instead, it felt like we were asked to give unnuanced blanket opinions. Also, readings were upwards of 40 dense pages per class, which wasn't fair considering how much other stuff we have to do as music students."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty easy and straightforward class. Lectures can be a bit dull, but the coursework is very manageable."
bien,music,216,spring,Inna Naroditskaya,2.94,2.69,2.87,2.75,2.53,5.14,"I came into this course thinking I would learn a lot about music in the present. While I did learn a lot, the structure of the course did not do the material justice. There are weekly quizzes on the material, and sometimes the questions are poorly phrased or about material that was barely discussed. The assignments/projects were only loosely based on class material, and the professor's style of teaching was a little all over the place. That being said, I really liked how the professor brought in guest speakers like contemporary composers."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very unstructured, a lot of Prof N talking at the class. I am training to become a professional orchestral musician (as are a lot of Bienen students, if not most) and it's hard for me to think of something I learned in this class that can help me achieve that goal."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Sometimes it's hard to follow what Prof N is saying, she goes on a lot of unrelated tangents."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There genuinely isn't anything positive to say about this course. I'm not sure which was worse, the weekly quizzes based on obscure facts in the readings or Naroditskaya's teaching abilities. Lectures mainly consisted of her going off on unintelligible tangents, making us look up the most random factoids ourselves (isn't it her job to teach us these things?), and getting cranky at people when they were looking down at their laptops for a few seconds too long instead of giving her all the attention she wants. Even having mentally prepared myself for this course in advance by reading the CTECs from previous years, I was still blown away by just how incoherent and disorganized everything was. The BSoM should be really embarrassed that they make this a required course for the music degree, there needs to be some serious revamping so that future students don't have to deal with Naroditskaya's incompetence. The one saving grace, however, was our wonderful TA, Vivian, who was very helpful and supportive throughout the course, including helping us with formatting our papers and frequently clearing up ambiguous information from Naroditskaya's lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Most people warned me about Inna, but honestly I didn't mind her. Yes she was a little quirky, but it also wasn't hard to get on her good side. The essays and class content are a little stupid, but she offers a lot of extra credit and that's nice."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is probably the most poorly organized class I have ever taken at Northwestern. Readings were long without providing much meaningful insight, lectures were essentially the professor rambling without any structure, and paper/assignment prompts were changed frequently or gave little direction as to what was expected. If you can avoid taking this class with Naroditskaya, I would advise doing so."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought this course was unnecessarily a lot of work, quizzes every Thursday and lots of reading. You were expected to know all the material about the readings each class and the teacher would call on people randomly. She also knows where everyone sits and takes attendance every class so it's hard to skip."
,,,,,,,,,,,There's a lot of reading to do for each week and I personally wasn't very interested in any of it. It's just about music around the world. There's two big research papers and a quiz every Thursday based on the readings. It's fine.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty good class. You get out what you put in. Topics are very very modern, less about music but more on music's effect on the world and vice verse."
,,,,,,,,,,,"While some of the content covered in the course was important and constructive, the most frustrating aspect of this class was the weekly quizzes and final exam. The concept of a weekly quiz that assess us on our knowledge gained from the lectures/readings makes sense. What upset me wasn't the fact that we had the quizzes but rather the content of the assessments themselves. Frequently, questions on the quizzes would include ultra–specific topics and minute details that were either briefly covered in the lectures/readings or — as was too often the case — not covered at all, leaving us to resort to guesswork. As a result, I believe these quizzes were incredibly counterproductive to our learning experience because they failed to adequately cover larger, more significant, over–arching concepts. The knowledge that we would have a near–impossible exam every week led students to prioritize rote memorization as opposed to gaining a long–lasting, impactful understanding of the topics covered."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is the worst lecture based class I've taken at Northwestern. Inna is a nice old schooled teacher with lots of passion and energy. However, she had very little organization of the course, no real structure and ineffective us class time. This class has been the biggest waste of time and should not be a required class if we aren't learning anything that actually benefits us as musicians. This is my problem with Bienen is all these required classes that just aren't useful or even applicable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Class is kind of all over the place, its different usually unrelated topics week to week, some of which are interesting but some of which could probably be switched for other stuff. Lot of readings that you have to do in the class because there are quizzes each week and a final exam at the end of the quarter. However, she offers a ton of extra credit so that is helpful for the grade, definitely do it."
bien,music,216,spring,Inna Naroditskaya,2.68,2.68,2.86,2.91,2.86,4.27,"Dr. Naroditskaya may genuinely be one of the smartest and most impressive professors I've taken a class with. Not only is she knowledgable on the varied topics this class covers, but she's also quite approachable during class and welcomes students to be open with her about their experiences in the class. Classroom management was something that distracted from the main talking points from time to time."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is quite disappointing especially given the potential that a course in present music could have. The way that Prof Naroditskaya teaches this course is acceptable for grad students who want a career in musicology but definitely not (a majority of) undergrad performance majors. The lectures emphasize factoids over big ideas, which is a waste of mental energy to cram in your head before lectures. She also lacks empathy (unless it's obvious that she made a mistake). Getting through this class isn't too bad, but I'm still glad it's over."
,,,,,,,,,,,Lectures are pretty scatterbrained and often drag on – it's hard to follow along with the topics
,,,,,,,,,,,Slides are not very helpful either
,,,,,,,,,,,Not sure why there are complaints about a class where you essentially get a free A.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Terrible course content. Instructor dances to Al Queda propaganda music, which is kind of the summation of this class. Embarrassing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was definitely more of an ethnomusicology class. I sort of understands how it relates to the suggested topic, but I can't see myself applying much of this knowledge."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think that I did end up learning bits and pieces of things that were relevant to what I found interesting, but I feel like it all went by so fast that I we never had the time to explore those topics."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really didn't enjoy this class. I think the way it was divided by week was good, but the topics it covered were very niche and didn't cover enough of the present world of music. There was more time spent on individual small cultures and particular practices, which were interesting to learn about, but didn't provide me with any wider understanding. I really think this course needs to be restructured and the topics need to be more general."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Naroditskaya, as a lecturer and person, is great. She is engaging, funny, and easy to listen to. However, the class structure and design leave much to be desired. While I have small gripes with the specificity of knowledge required from a large number of assigned readings, the instructions for the two essays, and the lack of availability of slides from the class, my main issue with this class is the topics it covers. A large majority of the class focuses on music in Azerbaijan and nearby areas – while an interesting topic at times, the class thus feels more like a 300–level class than an intro sequence. It is frustrating because while interesting, the topics do not align with what I hoped and expected to gain from the final quarter of the sequence."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm not totally sure what this course accomplished to be honest. Probably the most frustrating part of the course was how focused on details it was, all of the quizzes and discussion focused on certain people and details that didn't feel particularly relevant. I would've much preferred focusing on trends and overarching concepts rather than specific examples. The Canvas page was also incredibly disorganized and the readings were sometimes were fully incorrect, which made it frustrating. Workload is 2 papers, weekly quizzes (mentioned previously), and one group presentation, so not too much but not negligible."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is basically a 300–level specialized course in Azerbaijan, with the amount of course content revolving around Azerbaijani musical traditions and/or mugham. The weekly quizzes are extremely difficult for no reason and are virtually impossible to study for. Prof. Inna is very nice, but the class is not what its name advertises."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Probably actually the worst class I've taken at Northwestern so far. The course had absolutely no structure and no focus, and the topics covered each week were only tangentially related. Lectures were all over the place, and Naroditskaya spent most of class time clicking through the hundreds of tabs open on her laptop and showing random videos, articles, and anecdotes. Quizzes were given weekly. Almost all of them contained numerous typos, poorly–worded questions, and inaccurate information. The essays and assignments were fine, and the class was a very easy A, but for a class with a mandatory attendance policy, it was an incredibly ineffective and unproductive use of everyone's time. Bienen administration should really look into why this class (or any class in the current music history sequence, for that matter) is necessary for a degree requirement. Such a frustrating waste of time. Do not take this class unless you have to."
,,,,,,,,,,,The course was interesting but the readings could get boring. There was also a lot of material that seemed unnecessary.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is, hands down, the worst class I have taken at Northwestern. Naroditskaya is disorganized and an entirely ineffective lecturer who treats a room full of college students like kindergarteners. Take it because it's required, and pray to god that a different instructor teaches the course."
bien,music,226,fall,Alexandra Rinn,4.29,3.71,3.29,3.86,3.86,6.00,"Not a fan of the way this class was taught. Reinhart is the one creating the curriculum, and barely gives any room for the teacher to teach the way they want. He also doesn't tell us (through our teacher) important information regarding the exam, until the class before the exam?! It would be much more helpful if we didn't have to ask Reinhart questions through our teacher."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Something I don't like is that we will do dictations during class, but the number of plays will be different from the number of plays on the exam, for example. We should be practicing things the way we would be tested, otherwise there's no point."
,,,,,,,,,,,Because Reinhart designed the course it is emotionally taxing. Alexa is a good teacher she just needed some time to settle in. Perfect pitch kids need to chill it is not that funny.
,,,,,,,,,,,"this course needs to be better organized, in other words, needs to utilize class time in the best way possible. there is a large discrepancy between perfect–pitch students vs. regular hearing students vs, students who have studied ear training previously vs. students who have a natural apt for this subject. combining voice majors and instrumentalists leads to more chaotic class environments."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This quarter was pretty straightforward. Alexa was a fantastic instructor, and I improved a ton in just one quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Alexa was trying her best, but the class was almost always poorly organized and we rarely got much done. It felt like the instructors were as confused about the content as we were; the instructions were often vague and unclear, and Rhinehart only gives them access to their teaching plans the morning or night of. We consistently wasted 10 to 20 minutes per class arguing about unclear policies or concepts, and because nothing is standardized between instructors (and everyone has to defer to Rhinhart) we only got answers (if we got them at all) days later. Alexa is lovely and made a lot of improvements, but had a lot of trouble controlling and directing the class amidst such limiting circumstances."
bien,music,226,fall,Raymond Massoud,5.40,4.00,4.40,4.60,5.20,5.40,"Michal is a great instructor and does a great job in class of getting people to participate and be present. However, the class is very poorly designed and the curriculum does not make much sense. It does not seem like the instructors always understand what Dr. Reinhart wants to achieve and the it often gets very frustrating."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is great if you want to go to the gym for your ears. I don't like the form unit at all. Its arbitrary and difficult. Those things do not mix
,,,,,,,,,,,"Michal was a great teacher. He is very caring and is always willing to meet for extra practice if needed. Although the aural skills agenda is quite rigid, Michal was able to work with it and make the class more interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The difficulty of this course is very dependent upon the skills of the student. I have seen a wide range in abilities from people who have little aural skills training to people who are already very advanced (usually due to having perfect pitch). Nonetheless, in my experience, the instructors try to tailor the difficulty somewhere in the middle. This course requires a lot more work from some students than others, and those who are already very adept at this material may find only slight challenges. The course material was a bit disorganized, but one could argue that it allowed the training of all sorts of skills consistently. Nonetheless, instructors should consider the effectiveness of their materials and whether the aforementioned is the intended effect. I think the prepared singing was also a bit weird. We would cut off the last 10 minutes of class for it weekly. I realize this may be easier for the instructors than scheduling outside of class time, but it was nonetheless bizarre compared to the previous sequence where scheduling was made outside of class time. If that were ever to be re–instated, I think having the meetings on class days would be most effective as instructors would not have to be burdened on their usual days off–campus. My final suggestion for improvement concerns practice materials. The lack of online practice materials was frustrating. Instructors told students to help each other practice by playing on their instruments, but that is only part of what is helpful. I would have benefited from something like a list of repertoire to turn to that addressed material in class. Listening to recommended movements from classical/jazz/pop for form analysis, recommended classical/jazz/pop melodies for melodic and rhythmic dictation (in different registers from bass to soprano lines), and recommended musical passage for bass line/soprano/harmonic dictation practice. This is closer to what the previous year’s sequence did and much more helpful. For some of these, instructors don’t even need to give answers because the score is the answer. It’s just difficult to figure out what music to practice without getting a peak at the thing you want to study via the score, etc."
bien,music,226,fall,Raymond Massoud,5.71,4.14,4.71,5.00,5.29,5.86,I wish the hw and the test content were more similar. Also it would seem that students with perfect pitch were not challenged in anyway by aural skills at all. At times it can be frustrating seeing how little effort they have to put in to do well
,,,,,,,,,,,"Sometimes the class can be a bit fast–paced and there are definitely some disparities in the knowledge people come into the course with that causes some people to struggle in certain areas. Michal is wonderful, though. He genuinely cares about us and gives us lots of tools and strategies to succeed. Best teacher ever!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you have perfect pitch, this course will be almost impossible for you. The course is designed for those who don't have perfect pitch, and instructors will purposely make exercises harder for those who do have perfect pitch. For example, all dictations are played in a different key than what you're supposed to write, and all singing is done in a different key from what's written. If you don't have perfect pitch, this obviously doesn't affect you at all. But if you do, you're basically transcribing ALL THE TIME and it makes it extremely confusing and difficult. On top of that, none of the instructors have perfect pitch, and they are not understanding about it either. People have asked to create a separate class for those with perfect pitch, and have been dismissed, as apparently having a separate class does not do anything. This class will make you regret that you have perfect pitch. Good luck getting above a B in this class."

bien,music,226,fall,Carlos Bandera,4.86,3.86,4.29,4.86,5.14,7.01,It is a little infuriating and confusing why the first year and second year curriculum are completely disconnected. It would make perfect sense to use some version of Kenn Kumpf's software for practice and have that integrated into the class but it just isn't. Students are given a syllabus so it's hard to do anything ahead of time or get in practice when you actually can.
,,,,,,,,,,,It was very hard not knowing anything about what was going to be taught. I also didn’t like how we got study guides the class before the midterm or final.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really ridiculous that they wouldn't tell us what we would be learning until the class of; felt incredibly unstructured and disorganized. Carlos was kind, but I didn't feel like we were provided with any concrete strategies to do the INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT things we were being asked to do. Wish homework assignments and upcoming quizzes could be given with a week's notice because there is homework for EVERY CLASS PERIOD and somedays you're forced to sacrifice hours of sleep to do hw for this class/theory. I genuinely tried so hard to learn and grow in this class, but the curriculum is designed in such a way that they don't want students to succeed. The first year sequence was 10x better structured and better taught than this. The worst part is, as nasty as these CTECs are, they're not going to change anything about the course because they genuinely don't care. Good luck getting higher than a B+ in this."
,,,,,,,,,,,"quite unfair to perfect pitch people, requires little time commitment"
,,,,,,,,,,,"this course will for sure help strengthen your transcribing skills! carlos is incredibly kind and understanding! a super fun class overall and learned a lot. ONE THING though, it is SUPER disorganized (not the fault of the instructor). there would be times where material from the exams were only covered maybe ONCE at the beginning of the quarter. training material is not consistent or structured, and instructor sometimes would come in having just received the lesson plan the day of the class. i think whoever is in charge of creating the course outline could definitely do a better job. in fact, i think they NEED to do a better job. this sequence was borderline catastrophic sometimes, and it wasn't like this last year."

Practice the prepared singings/arpeggios. Pay attention to the homework. The class kind of leaves you to tread water by yourself, so good luck."
,,,,,,,,,,,fourth year aural skills is overall not the worst. I find some of the content unnecessary and some of the content unnecessarily challenging. I feel most of the quiz questions do not even help me with improving sight singing ability where first year aural skills heavily focused on. Instead we spend time listening to music to see if it is ternary or binary form.

You're either good or not good and will always be at a disadvantage to people with perfect pitch so don't stress yourself over this class. Rinn improved a lot this quarter and was very understanding and implored useful communication techniques for both teaching and relating with students.

Things start to get more tricky, with modulating dictations and more elements of chromatic harmony, but nothing which wasn't manageable.

bien,music,226,spring,Raymond Massoud,5.38,3.75,3.75,3.38,4.50,4.00,"Honestly hate this class, Good riddance! Professor Michal is a really good aural skills teacher and showed a lot of passion and energy in his classes which was much appreciated and impressive giving the content. He also incorporated different music and ideas of learning which I think helped some students. He was also pretty understanding and strict on the course which was a good balance. Most of all I think his greatest strength was his care for students and trying to help everyone out and involve them in class even if they didn't want to be involved. However, this class still sucks so much, it's difficult but doable even without any practice. I do not have perfect pitch and never practiced and will still get a B in the class. If you practiced like 30 mins 3 times a week you'd definitely be fine. However, it's just a class for overachievers to practice how good they can go through different aural trainings. People with perfect pitch just breeze through it and it is just pain for everyone else; really doesn't matter how much you practice you probably would not get an A so don't waste too much time on it. I also really hated having to come to 27 classes over the quarter because the class time did not help me improve in any way! That's 1350 minutes of wasted time but I attended much less than that because I always came late. Overall Second year aural skills is unnecessary and should not be a requirement. Goodluck with the class and try to get friends to practice with every now and then and you should be fine; One more quarter and you'll be done! Beyond happy to be done, the feeling is surreal!!!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class caters to relative pitch people while people with perfect pitch skate by with no need to put in effort. I felt bored and not challenged. I wish I was able to improve my ears and improve the accuracy and versatility/speed of my hearing, but because the curriculum doesn’t give individual attention to people with aural skills of different levels and only focuses on a baseline one–size fits–all standard of ear training, I felt that I entered this class at the beginning of the ear with exactly the same expertise as when I left. Perhaps the only different thing was that I now knew how to sing in solfege, which is not terribly useful to me (aka I will probably never use it in my life except for in the unlikely event that I decide I want to teach primary school music)."
,,,,,,,,,,,Michal does a great job of pushing past the often narrow scope established by Reinhardt and keeping things interesting and relatively fast–paced

I think every musician should take this just because experiencing pain and performance anxiety are such problems that musicians experience. The Alexander technique does make such a big difference in people's playing as I saw through seeing the teacher help others. However, if you have injuries, your injuries won't go away just from taking this class, but this class is a good and important introduction to it."

If there were more in class activities, the class would be more interested in what he was saying. You do large project so make sure you like the topic your group chooses because you will have to follow through with it as if you were going to actually create your solution. Overall not much work, but guest lecturers are very interesting."

He is super knowledgeable and is just a really great instructor. 1000% recommend this class."

We each pitched a startup idea that would solve a music industry–related problem, then worked in groups to actually develop these ideas and begin the prototyping process.

The class is also three hours on Friday which can be a lot, and it feels like we always move slowly during class and could save a significant portion of the time if we were a little more efficient. That being said, the professor is very passionate about the topic, and I am very excited to move forward with the project."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoy how this course blends in–class theory with outside–of–class community work, but note that it also feels limiting in terms of the flexibility students get when it comes to structuring what they want to get out of the certificate program. This is a real–world campaign, so don't expect to be able to have much control over the community activities that one would want to engage in. Expect to be willing to sacrifice some individual autonomy in order to work as part of a larger campaign."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is required for the Civic Engagement Certificate. The explanation of what the certificate will look like does not exactly match up with the class. If you're really interested in community organizing with a heavy emphasis on canvassing, you'll like the class. The project is really interesting and really important but the class is mostly canvassing other students and Evanston residents to join the project which requires a lot of weekend mornings and time during the day."
sesp,sesp,195,winter,Matthew Easterday,2.00,2.56,2.11,2.11,2.33,9.22,"Before you register, note that this course isn't what's advertised on the Certificate web page. This course focuses on 1 campaign – Participatory Budgeting – and offers no flexibility/autonomy with regards to exploring other campaigns. Students are expected to bear the brunt of hours of weekly campaign work (e.g. canvassing, which non–student volunteers are not willing to undertake) because their grades depend on it, and their assignments are also dictated *for* them – rather than *by* them – due to the expectations set by local city government in collaboration with campaign leadership. This course seems to place a greater focus on the outcomes of the campaign rather than the priorities of the students, and there have been instances where students have felt criticized/shamed for even bringing up their complaints about the course curriculum. Do not take this course if you're looking for a student–led civic learning experience; this class very much follows a rigid, externally pre–determined campaign structure that prides itself in a greater ""civic impact"" – but at the expense of the individual autonomy of the student volunteer."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class sounds like it will be amazing but ends up being very disappointing. Matt is misleading with what we're going to be working on and then criticizes us for not being able to follow through on unrealistic expectations. After putting in a ton of work all quarter, he essentially told us that we're not at all helpful for the PB Evanston project (despite the city PB manager telling us differently). The certificate should be a really great program that allows students to do hands–on community work and put their organizing and service knowledge into practice but, instead, it's a frustrating course led by a professor who is out of touch with how students actually learn."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Do not take this class, even if you think that the idea of a ""civic engagement certificate"" appeals to you. You're signing up for 5–6 quarters of a lot of stress, a stubborn instructor, and the loss of your Friday afternoons for 2 years. The project, PB Evanston (which a lot of students weren't aware was the entirety of the class), is something I really care about and am invested in, but you don't have to be in the certificate to participate or make a difference whatsoever. In fact, by not signing up for the class, you're saving yourself so much time, energy, and sanity. All of us (students) were able to create a close bond with each other because of the immense frustration we all felt, and that was the only bright side of the class. Even when we voiced everything we were feeling (aka the entirety of the project only functioning because we were sacrificing our time and energy for the class), the professor interpreted our words as if we didn't care about the project, when we very very clearly do. Overall, take care of yourself by not signing up for the program. It's not worth it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Before getting into whether taking this class is actually a good idea, it is important to note the class is nothing like what it is advertised to be. We barely worked on policy, and frequently much–too–high metrics got in the way of genuine involvement in the community. Rather, the class is about fulfilling a list of organizing–related objectives to almost singlehandedly run participatory budgeting — a program supposed to be run by the city. The metrics are very organizing–focused (signups, 1:1s, attendance at out–of–class events). However, their existence often takes the community involvement out of organizing, turning organizing into a transactional process as opposed to a community–building one, which the class emphasizes participatory budgeting is meant to be. Students are (in my opinion) unfairly expected to meet practically all the city's signup goals, meaning we frequently do busy work to get the project to where it needs to be and not work that enhances our organizing (or policy development) skills. The time requirements of the class are misleading. Though class time is only technically 2–5 every Friday, several weeks we had external–to–class scheduled activities (ranging from steering committee meetings Wednesday 6–8, canvassing on weekends or at the high school as early as 8am, budget delegate meetings 11–1 on Saturdays, etc. After an attempt in fall quarter, the class never returned to organizing theory — there is no learning involved, just practice (which is in some ways a strong suit and a weak point of the class, especially considering much of the class involves meeting metrics described without feeling like a part of the decision–making / larger context at play."
,,,,,,,,,,,I learned from the Evanston community and my peers more than the coursework and instruction in this class. This class helped me learn what I really value about civic engagement. Having grades to quantify and evaluate the success of one's campaign and work took away a lot of motivation to actually organize and engage with the community. I would not recommend the certificate program in its current structure which is disappointing but there are many other ways to form meaningful relationships and interactions with the Evanston community.
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was what I expected: hands on, learning more about Evanston, being civically involved, but there's sometimes busy work and sometimes I don't know where the class is headed. There's trainings done during class so technically it's not that repetitive, but I feel like nothing is gained from class time. And it still feels like the whole project we're doing is a slowly trudging machine. It's all well intended and there have been good outcomes in the community, but most of my peers and I seem burnt out, unmotivated, and have no personal connection to it. In the end, it just feels burdening to be in this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is not as it is described on the SESP website and that should be changed. This class just meets for three hours on Fridays which seems bad but honestly it doesn't start until 2 and we usually got out at least an hour early. I think that this was a good way to get involved directly with the Evanston community. However, I do not feel that Matt Easterday adequately teaches this course. I was new to the course this quarter and he pretty much left all of the teaching to my group members who have been in the course. He also was unwilling to hear us out when he expected us to give up 10 hours of our weeks to the project. I would like to see a professor who is more encouraging with their students."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed aspects of this course, but I think there were frustrating moments because the grading and goals were not what I had expected or what I was told to expect in previous quarters. Also, it feels like we're repeating a lot of the topics covered in previous quarters instead of learning new skills and strategies for advocacy. However, I know the professor is very passionate about the topic and wants to work with students to make sure the course fits our hopes which I appreciate."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Going into this class from last quarter, I knew that it wasn't going to really be structured in the way that I would have liked. Again, the emphasis on canvassing being tied to my grade in the class was a little stressful and felt extremely transactional. Additionally, the lack of choice we had in this class was also upsetting. The class description does not indicate that PB Evanston would be the campaign for this class, so I was surprised when I entered the class and was told this was the project we would be working, especially in light of Matt's inherent ties to the project and city, which I see as being a serious conflict of interest. I see that relationship as being problematic to the class, the certificate program, and most importantly, the well–being and learning of the students in the class who, at times, are being taken advantage of by Matt and the City of Evanston by performing unpaid labor."
sesp,sesp,195,spring,Matthew Easterday,1.83,2.17,1.83,1.83,2.00,7.66,refer to WI2023 CTECs
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you haven't already, I encourage you to read the CTECs for this class from Winter 2023. Even after a quarter, those evaluations still hold true. All of us continue to have our efforts quantified by our grades, and no matter how much time or dedication we put into this class, we still face a lot of pressure to live up to the expectations set by the professor. We all try so hard to make this project, PB Evanston, work and have quite literally become the backbone of the campaign, but our work seems to have no value. I don't think this class will improve whatsoever in this upcoming year, even with a new professor added to the mix. You will still be working on PB Evanston, and you will still have your efforts quantified by arbitrary metrics of grading. I wish I could look back on my two years in this certificate and say it was worth it and that I loved it, but all I can say is that I've learned so much more from my friends and peers than I ever have from the actual class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This quarter was better than last quarter with the creation of the squad lead role which helped to streamline the check–in process and also acted as a buffer between Matt and the students. Regardless, the unreasonable goals from the previous quarter increased with the addition of recruiting 4 volunteers. At the beginning of the quarter, roles were assigned to some people in the class, often without their consent or knowledge, and Matt encouraged the leadership team to share their ideas for what the goals should be like for the quarter. It was helpful that the goals were team goals this quarter instead of group goals because this helped to address certain people's strengths, but there were also suggestions made by folks on the leadership team that were not even considered and were quickly dismissed. This initial discussion felt frankly unsafe, particularly when students tried to ask questions and challenge Matt's thinking. In terms of the budget delegate process, for some of the committees, students were taking on most of the roles of policy development, again in a largely unpaid scenario. In addition, there was a requirement, as there has been for this entire year, to attend all of the steering committee meetings and budget delegate meetings happening this quarter. I consistently asked Matt throughout the quarter what the make–up option would be for missing these meetings, knowing that I would be missing two towards the end of the quarter, and during each conversation, Matt dismissed me by saying that he was still thinking about what the make–up would be. At the end of the quarter, after multiple students insisted on knowing what the make–up would be, Matt informed us that it would be 10 extra sign–ups per meeting missed because it was late in the quarter and it would not make sense for us to do 1:1s if we were leaving for the summer. For me, that entailed completing 20 sign–ups in the span of 1 week – from the time Matt informed us about the make–up to the time when all sign–ups and other goals were due. I found this to be incredibly unreasonable, uncommunicative, and convenient for Matt who avoided providing us with that information until he could create a make–up option that would numerically benefit him. I think this class has so much potential, and I feel sad that I cannot take it next year, knowing that Matt will be teaching it again and implementing a class structure that once again revolves around PB Evanston. Matt is not someone I consider to be a good organizer, and he does not understand his positionality nor does he value a co–educational relationship with his students. I would not recommend taking this class or pursuing the Civic Engagement Certificate as the program is run now, especially if you are someone who would like to productively engage with the Evanston community. Until SESP changes the leadership, oversight, and structure of this program, I, unfortunately, cannot recommend it to anyone."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is not what it is described to be. I think that the Civic Engagement Certificate needs serious re–modeling. I don't think that this class adequately equipped me with the tools that I thought it would. Matt honestly does not do much to teach us, but rather gives us assignments and expects us to know what to do."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Honestly, this class was really frustrating and I wish I had gotten more out of it. After two years in the certificate program, I wanted to learn and develop new skills but it felt like we were just doing the same work for a campaign without any autonomy or input. The parts of the campaign we were excited about were not at all the focus, and when we provided feedback or shared our frustration, nothing changed. I understand that there is little flexibility in campaigns like this, but as a course, there should have been different expectations. Also, the activities or discussions held in class were very repetitive, especially after taking this class for two years, and I don't think I really learned anything new in the 10 weeks of this quarter."
sesp,sesp,200,fall,Lilah Shapiro,5.44,5.08,4.64,4.12,5.32,4.60,"Professor Schapiro is wonderful at having you apply what you learned in class to real world examples and essay applications. there are a few essays due along the course of the quarter that require you to synthesize ideas and the information definitely builds on itself along the quarter. Be aware that it is a very discussion driven class, but Professor Schapiro is a great facilitator and very knowledgeable about her field. It isn't a particularly difficult class, but one I really enjoyed taking."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course provides a lot of interesting and valuable new ideas but it didn't feel like it had enough content for an entire quarter. Many of the readings were very interesting but it felt like a stretch to have two 80 minute classes to discuss the content each week. This class is graded very reasonably.
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a really great course. The content was really interesting and definitely challenged my thinking as well as allowing me to develop my own ideas.
,,,,,,,,,,,It is a non–strenuous class and professor Shapiro is very nice and understanding.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, I enjoyed this course, and Professor Shapiro is extremely sweet and accommodating. It could definitely be tedious at times, especially because it is designed to be a seminar course but class participation was extremely low. And, while we didn't delve as deeply into the various facets of knowledge as I would have hoped we could have, the course was still interesting. It definitely changed the way I think about and process information. There were only 3 short content reflections and a final group presentation, all graded fairly easily. I would recommend this course as a bit of a blow–off."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this course and thought that the material was interesting overall, the only thing is sometimes the lectures became long."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was pretty good. Shapiro is very sweet and if you are someone who likes to participate you will be fine. I didn't do the readings really so doing the assignments took some BSing but you can still participate without them. A lot of the discussions feel like you are rehashing the same things over and over again sometimes.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Understanding knowledge is a really great intro class to SESP. Basically, this course goes over the different types of knowledge we see in our world, examines how they are constructed, and what biases may be present in each type of knowledge. Professor Shapiro did a great job of delivering the key ideas of the course content through mainly a class discussion style. She also inspired us to apply these seemingly abstract theories to our own lives through the memo discussion papers. I found this to be very valuable since it allows us to connect these theories to our worlds, and she and the TA Ben always gave great feedback that inspired more thought around these topics. The final is relatively easy: it is a final project that makes us integrate our learning and apply it to a specific, real–world issue. All in all, this course is pretty easy, but also very intellectually stimulating, so I would recommend it!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Shapiro is awesome — she's super friendly, approachable, understanding, and knowledgeable. The final presentations at the end of the quarter were super interesting — all the groups came up with very creative ways to apply the theoretical frameworks we learned about. The readings could sometimes be quite extensive and dense, and the grading on the assignments was quite lenient (typical SESP class), so there wasn't necessarily a huge incentive to avoid skimming the readings. I think some of the in–class assignments were interesting but didn't really teach me more about the topic/theoretical framework besides what I already knew. I think diving deeper into the frameworks in the in–class assignments and laying out each of the unique ideas from the frameworks would've helped me have a better sense of the ""new"" content I was getting with each reading. The class lecture/sdiscussions were the most helpful for understanding the content. Some of the topics regarding power and privilege could feel like we were going in circles about saying that people with power get to control who believes/knows/learns/hears what, which is pretty intuitive. The most interesting parts of these ideas, however, were the specific ways these theories manifested themselves, such as how social dynamics impact scientific research far more than we tend to think. I would've appreciated if Prof. Shapiro focused a bit more on such unintuitive details with the other frameworks. Watching The Sixth Sense, Flat Earth documentary, and Social Dilemma documentary was great to learn about class content in an enjoyable way. Overall, I'd say you'd get a lot more out of the class if you do the readings — at least getting the major takeaways BEFORE class so that when you come to class, you can understand how Prof. Shapiro elaborates on those ideas and also so you can contribute to the discussion."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a requirement for SESP majors, so you can't really get out of it but I do think that coming out of it, some topics were pretty enlightening and gave me a new perspective on where my information is coming from. I feel like a lot of the readings were pretty dense and not super interesting but Professor Shapiro makes an effort to clear up any confusion and help us to understand it better during class. The homework basically consists of two discussion questions/analytic points about the assigned reading/video for the next class and it's a completion grade. There's some small group assignments sprinkled in as well. There's a final assignment at the end of the quarter with a group about a topic of your choosing. Overall, not a super challenging class and very chill."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall great class. Highly recommend, not too much work"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Although parts of this course were challenging to wrap my brain around (pretty philosophical), it was really important stuff to think about!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"this class is a really easy intro class: not super intensive readings, lots of engaging activities, and simple but reflective assignments. A good class about epistemology to get you to think if you've never thought about knowledge production before."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Distribution: initial reflection – 5%, 2 discussion questions per class (can skip 2 classes of it) – 20%, critical discussion memos (3) – 35%, in–class exercises – 10%, group project presentations – 5%, final reflection – 5%, class contributions – 5%"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I chose to take Understanding Knowledge because it's a SESP core requirement. I was super pleased with the class overall, though. Lilah Shapiro is an AMAZING professor. She's so interesting and passionate, and our discussions every class were really insightful. I will say that the structure of discussions can sometimes be a little monotonous, as it was pretty much the same few people talking in class and no one else really participated. If you're not participating, it can be a little boring at times. Other than that, you just have to write 3 short essays, 2 reflections (one at the start and one at the end of the quarter), and a group project for the final. The grading is really awesome, and I think reflects your effort. If you put in a baseline of effort, you will definitely see rewards. Make sure you come into the class with an open mind and it will be a super awesome quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,Fairly easy class. If you follow the assignment instructions you will most likely get a 100. The class was structured as a discussion instead of a lecture which was nice.
sesp,sesp,200,winter,Lilah Shapiro,5.45,5.14,4.77,4.45,5.10,3.52,Easy class
,,,,,,,,,,,Good class. Mr. Shapiro is great and really cares about the subject and her students.
,,,,,,,,,,,Take this class with Professor Shapiro!
,,,,,,,,,,,this is such a classic sesp course
,,,,,,,,,,,one of the best classes ive taken at northwestern
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is just one of those classes that you have to get through in SESP. It's not particularly mind–blowing, but it's a nice break from taking harder classes, especially during winter quarter. Professor Shapiro is super nice, understanding, and caring, and she always checks in to make sure we're doing well. If you can take this during your first year, do it – otherwise, the class just feels rather tedious since you've already gotten used to/had an introduction to SESP classes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class was great! Not a huge time commitment but I learned a lot. Lilah was also great, she always tried to take our feelings into consideration and was generally super sweet."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a requirement, and nothing to be scared of. It is straightforward and easy, only a bit tedious with the amount of work they give you (daily readings, 3 week block memos, often movie requirements). Overall, easy to do well"
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this course and Professor Shapiro is the best. She is so nice and caring and wants to make sure her students are doing okay. Class was engaging and I learned a lot through the assignments and final project. Felt comfortable in this class too and looked forward coming to class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I recommend taking this class early on in your time at SESP. It's great for creating a solid foundation around many subjects, but it will be repetitive if you are an upperclassman. However, Lilah tries her best to engage the class in conversations around each subject and is great at considering all perspectives."
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this class! Shapiro's instruction was very insightful and I loved the content she chose to cover. Very manageable workload about super interesting topics
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great class, definitely take it with Professor Shapiro. There was weekly discussion posts, a few essays, and a group project, but all were manageable and mostly just reflection. The content of the class was really interesting so I never dreaded doing the work. The class was a lot of group work and discussion, so it never felt like the same thing every day. Professor Shapiro is one of the nicest and most understanding professors I've ever had and always kept the class interesting."
sesp,sesp,200,spring,Lilah Shapiro,5.56,5.11,4.84,4.68,5.56,4.75,"Schapiro is singlehandedly one of the best professors I've ever had and deserves no slander. She genuinely cares about her students so much and goes out of her way to make this class as accessible as possible. She is flexible and even offers a Zoom option for class if you are ill. This does not mean you aren't learning though– the discussions and reading materials were really thought–provoking Sometimes the busy work could get annoying, especially when you have a lot of homework for other classes, but I would say it's definitely manageable. Short(!!!) discussion posts (and you can skip two), three three–page essays (the materials for this are basically provided in class so it's not too difficult), in–class activities, and a final project that she gives you time to work on in class. Overall would recommend, especially as someone coming into this class reluctantly."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Awesome class that made me rethink everything I thought I knew about the concept of knowledge. Readings and a discussion post due every class, a memo due every three weeks, and a final presentation are the bulk of the assignments. Professor Shapiro centers class time around student discussion and small–group work, so the hour and a half goes by quickly!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Honestly, the topic of this class is kind of ambiguous and it goes a little but all over the place, but overall it is interesting. Lilah brings up some really interesting discussion topics, and if you're willing to bring your brain to class and engage with the topics, I think you can get a lot out of the class. Sometimes things got a little too meta for me, but very SESP–esk."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Your usual SESP class with lots of group assignments, 3 reflection papers, discussion points for each class, and a group presentation at the end of the quarter. Not sure if I really understand knowledge now, but we touched on a lot of different topics from anti–vaxxers and flat earthers to social media, and it definitely left me with a lot of unanswered questions. Very heavily discussion based so get ready to spend pretty much all class talking. Professor Shapiro is amazing and so understanding really appreciate her and you can tell she truly cares about her students <3"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is very interesting, a lot of liberal propaganda and could probably could give more of an unbiased perspective. With that being said there was a lot of cool information being dispersed. Giving lots of us more to think about"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Shapiro is AMAZING. great class, even if you're not a SESP major, highly recommend taking this."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Lilah is one of the most amazing professors I've ever had at Northwestern. She is understanding, caring, witty, and knowledgeable. While this class was a requirement, I never felt like there was work that was tedious. She paced the class well, and it felt like she wouldn't penalize you for not finishing the readings or assignments because she valued students' thoughts and participation in class. The assignments were weekly readings, discussion posts of two questions twice a week, three 3–page writing assignments positioned across the quarter, and a final presentation. The class sometimes felt rushed a little, but Lilah always makes a good discussion out of the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed the lectures and the essays, as they allowed us to be very open–minded with our thinking"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Decent class. Major requirement for SESP, so you have to take it anyway. Not too much work and grading doe"
sesp,sesp,201,fall,Keira Leneman,3.24,2.65,3.71,3.82,3.06,6.06,"This course was, well, interesting. Professor Leneman is very passionate about what she is teaching and this is clearly shown through her lectures. However, my main feedback is that the course assignments don't seem to be aligned with the objective of the class, especially the grading scale. In most of the big assignments we had like the Article Review and the Policy Memo, the graders are very nit–picky with the details, which seems to miss the bigger picture of testing to see whether we actually learned the content or not. Professor Leneman is very responsive to this feedback and listened to many of our suggestions. She definitely tried her best to implement changes to make this course better, however, many of the changes don't seem to tackle the real root of the problem. As a result, I feel like the class objective and the assignments can appear confusing and frustrating."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was really interesting material–wise, although a bit reminiscent of AP Psych. If that's what you're into, you'll love it. Professor Leneman, while clearly very passionate about teaching and this subject, is definitely still adjusting to SESP's environment when it comes to her grading expectations. If you're not interested in having exams and tough grading, maybe wait for another professor. However, the tests really aren't that bad if you follow the study guides. Leneman was really receptive about people's issues with her grading and worked to adjust accordingly. I think improvement is still needed, but not a lot of professors at NU would sit down for an hour and a half while students critiqued their class setup and then actually take it to heart, so for that I have a lot of respect for her."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Please do not take 201 with this professor, you'll be significantly better off with others. In summary, Leneman is clearly a new professor to Northwestern whose class is consequently drastically different (and not for the better) than the traditional expectations of SESP. To represent the countless who dropped this class and therefore cannot fill out CTECs, Leneman's grading, rubrics, and overall expectations were harsh and unnecessarily confusing. In the middle of the quarter, it became so severe we had to have a town hall where students were verbally and physically upset. Even after the town hall, students continued to remain upset and unsatisfied with the ""changes."" At one point I felt sympathetic for Leneman due to all the backlash, however, after her lack of effort to work with students, my sympathies quickly shifted to our class for facing the consequences of this lack of preparation and care by Leneman."
,,,,,,,,,,,"DON'T take this class if you don't have to. Dr. Leneman, while super knowledgeable on the topic, taught the class in a way that felt very reminiscent of a high school class, but she and TA expected us to understand the material at the level of a graduate student. Class was super unorganized, felt as if TA and prof only talked every two weeks, and grading was severely harsh. Half of class dropped at drop date because of the teaching. Even after a class period solely devoted to discussing our concerns, which I thought was generous of the prof to do, she did almost nothing to the actual formatting and system of the class, and there were constant discussions of students about how stressed and unhappy we were with the class and how it was formatted and specifically the grading. I'm not sure if this is because Dr. Leneman is a first time professor, but the grading scale had the expectation of graduate student knowledge for an entry level class (e.g., an early assignment had an average grade of 62%, and we were told no curve for the final grade)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course needs some tweaking for next quarter. I felt that Professor Leneman was trying to create a challenging course because it was her first course at Northwestern, which is known to be a prestigious school. This is understandable but frustrating when other SESP courses were apparently more conducive to learning by grading subjectively and not objectively to perpetuate a low–stress, high–comprehension environment. Leneman is very nit–picky with grades and gave way more assignments than any other class I took. Additionally, when I would ask for clarification about questions, she would tell me everything was great and correct, and I would still get answers wrong and poor grades. It made improving in class challenging. Finally, it also felt very English–heavy because I would submit a DRAFT and be marked down for English errors. In my opinion, drafts should always be completion/effort based because you are supposed to make mistakes and improve. There was no room for mistakes in her class. She tried to hear us out on the grading but became a little passive aggressive. Would I take this course again? No."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought that this class was going to be less of a traditional psych class and more collaborative and open ended. And because of how by–the–book it was, I know that I really struggled to keep up with the content a lot of the time. The grading was super rigid, too. Overall, the inflexibility made it hard to enjoy the class, especially knowing that the class didn't used to be so rigid."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a content heavy class but the workload for it is manageable with a reflection due before class and 5 major assignments: two article reviews and a policy memo paper split into three parts. Grading was a lot tougher in the beginning, but Dr. Leneman was understanding of the overall grievances and held a lecture strictly to reform and change the things that weren't working out. Lots of scientific articles to read for the course and many have to do with the major assignments. As long as you take notes and pay attention in class then you'll do pretty good on the midterm and final although you may have to review specific information."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought the course was okay but the lectures were often very boring and didn't arouse much interest within me. Moreover, I don't think this is a problem with the material itself but Moreso the way she went about her lectures. We had plenty of guest lecturers throughout the quarter and they felt more energetic and engaging. I didn't really mind the coursework as much as other students, but I feel like that's going to be a popular criticism in her course evaluations."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think the biggest problem with this class was honestly that it felt like the assignments were out of so few points that any minor slip up could lead to huge problems grade–wise. However, the material was really interesting and easy enough to understand"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class became better throughout the quarter. It started out very confusing with way too much pressure and too high of expectations. Earlier on, grading was strict with little room for creativity, making me struggle in the class. The professor did admit faults though and tried to improve later on in the quarter though there were definitely still some teaching methods I didn’t agree with or find particularly helpful. I personally value stress free learning very highly so, in some aspects, this class was slightly disappointing as it didn’t quite give that."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was unnecessarily difficult. Grading is harsh and lecture slides are not helpful on their own making review for exams more taxing. Would not recommend.
,,,,,,,,,,,The Professor was very open to change and I believe she will improve each time she does this course! She helped anyone that went to office hours but I do wish there were more assignments lining up to the material we are learning in the class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think this quarter could be considered a bit of an outlier for this course, so take all comments with a grain of salt. Dr. Leneman was really passionate about the subject, there was just a disconnect between what the students anticipated for the course (based on description, CTECs, and prior students) and how it was taught. With a redesigned course structure, Dr Leneman would have done a really great job. One positive note is that she really did her best to integrate student feedback into her teaching and lesson plans"
,,,,,,,,,,,Do NOT take this course with Professor Lenneman if you can help it.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was very excited about this class going in because I'm love childhood development, but the focus of the class was all over the place. Lenneman is super passionate about race and racism and while that's great and all, it felt like I was attending two completely different classes sometimes because we would learn about the basics of childhood development in class and then 99% of our homework and assignments outside of class would be all about race and racism with barely any connection to childhood development. And then our actual midterm was just focused on childhood development, so while the reading assignments about race and racism were interesting in themselves, they had no connection to the actual things we were being tested on. She is so focused on being woke and trying to come across as politically correct 98% of the time, that she actually lectured about development only about 2% of the time. As a POC, I was also very uncomfortable with some of the things she said, including how she tried to enforce her beliefs about 'Whiteness culture' on the class once by making an entire lecture slide about them. I'm still not sure how that was appropriate or why that was relevant. She attempts to be aware of her positionality, but it seems very performative and I was very uncomfortable with how some race issues were approached – especially by a white woman in a white–dominated class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As for the grading... she is the most nitpickiest grader I have ever met. Her rubrics in themselves are very odd (we could lose up to 3 points on a 14 point assignment if we got an indentation on our references page wrong), and half the class got C's and D's during the first half of the quarter for the tiniest mistakes. She would take off points for things that weren't on the rubric and say ""I know this wasn't on the rubric, but that's what was EXPECTED"" so having a rubric didn't even do anything because her grading was just completely subjective to the things that she wanted that weren't clearly expressed to the class. The assignments themselves are two article reviews and a three–part policy memo. We were never instructed on how to actually complete an article review, and we had a policy memo workshop lecturing on what a policy memo actually was AFTER the first two parts were already due and the third part was due in only a few days. The timeline of instruction is completely all over the place, and it's very hard to find coherence between not only the assignments themselves, but also between the subject of the assignment and what we're actually learning in class because again, the assignments were mostly focused on things like racial inequities while the actual content of the lectures were about children's emotional developmental timeline. And the wording... God, you have to go over your wording 10000000000000X over before submitting because if you use even two words that were used in the assigned article, she accuses you of plagiarism, and if you try to reword it, she says that what you said isn't accurate. It's exhausting. Most of my work outside of class was hyperfocused on trying to word things in a way that she'll like, instead of actually learning and absorbing and applying the content."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures themselves are also pretty bad. Slides have almost no information on them, it's a picture and a few words, and that makes reviewing harder because Lenneman tends to go on a tangent when she speaks and it's hard to just find the basics of what you need to know for the exams. Biggest complaint has to do with research studies: she tests you on research studies, but doesn't give you ANY information about them – just the name, a one–liner about the result, and a 1 min video about the procedure. Everything else, we have to do on our own."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I will give credit where credit is due – Lenneman is very nice, and she's willing to listen to the students and try to make changes depending on the feedback they give. There was a class dedicated to a ""town hall"" about grades because everyone was so tired of her nitpicky grading and going from an A to a C because they used the word ""insufficient"" instead of ""inadequate."" I'm not sure how the class was impacted by this though, because she was absent for most of the quarter after that and left the teaching up to guest speakers and the grading to our TA. Another good thing is that there's lots of extra credit opportunities through participation points and reflections, so you can work to bring up your grade by consistently doing those."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a major requirement for SESP students so if you're taking it with Lenneman, know that she is a very sweet person – just be prepared to simultaneously take a class on how to be woke as taught and encouraged by a white–dominant environment, and teaching yourself everything outside the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course's materials were completely unrelated to the subject. The professor graded way too harsh and completely unrelated to the assignments. Way too many were taken off for simple stuff like formatting. Dr. Leneman said she wanted to change things multiple times, yet nothing ever changed ever."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was unorganized and the professor was not engaging. The first 6 weeks were a mess and there were huge levels of stress ad anxiety for nearly all students. I found the information in this class boring and the lectures needed improvement. I do think this class will be better in future quarters, but I would wait for a different professor. The TA was awesome though!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would urge students not to take a course taught by Professor Leneman. She is a nitpicky grader and an ineffective communicator. She and her TA were rarely on the same page about assignment instructions or grading, leading to score discrepancies. She would also occasionally change rubrics the night before an assignment was due. I believe that the class, as it is presently taught, is far too unpredictable for me to recommend."
sesp,sesp,201,winter,Terri Sabol,5.27,4.80,4.93,4.93,4.93,8.13,"Take this class with Prof. Sabol if you can! Her class set–up is easily one of the most organized, thought–provoking, and integrated with the latest news on educational developments. I am normally a critic rather than a promoter. However, this class is so well–set up that I hardly have any complaint. Take this class, and you will not regret it."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is set–up in a really nice way — two short papers and one final paper. The two short papers set you up for the final paper. Zina and Prof Sabol provide such great feedback on the two short papers. They really want you to do well
,,,,,,,,,,,Identifying and comparing different theoretical frameworks for child and adolescent development.
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you need to take this class, take it with Professor Sabol. She is the sweetest! She's very understanding as well, and makes sure that the environment is very comfortable for others to speak in discussions. She's very organized and her slides are very engaging. She integrates theory into recent news, such as the recent rise of certain videos on youtube gaining popularity amongst their child viewers. Discussion posts are straight forward, and one is due every week. There are two short papers regarding theory and context of a certain policy you want to implement. The final is a 10 page paper on the policy you have been researching for the quarter. Wasn't that hard, and the professor is really well at engaging students in her class. Take this with her!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very informative course, would have have liked to have covered more adolescent and secondary school education subjects."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Sabol is an interesting and engaging lecturer who can make semi–boring concepts really interesting. She's approachable to talk to, and wants to make sure concepts are truly understood. Highly recommend taking this course with her if you can."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot, but 3 hour class does feel long."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Class was okay. Professor Sabol and TA were nitpicking for grades. Both very passionate about the subject. However just seemed like constantly learning about things previously done, not working to apply to our lives or to build on in the future"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a good introductory class on early childhood and adolescent development. I really enjoyed Terri and Zina's presence and the knowledge and humor they brought to the classroom. It's obvious they are passionate about their study. The readings were always interesting, but I could never finish all of them, no matter how hard I tried. I liked the discussion posts because they held us accountable to doing the readings. The only thing I struggled with was the final paper. I understand the purpose of making it as long as it was, but I felt like I had a lot of workload in this class compared to my other graduate courses. It felt too much sometimes."
sesp,sesp,201,winter,Keira Leneman,5.23,1.92,1.08,3.75,4.54,3.31,This class was just okay. The assignments are graded easily but are challenging and time consuming assignments.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was great, Prof. did a great job understanding the needs/vibe of the class and was able to adjust accordingly. Class was informative and stimulating but not excessive work at all."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course is centralized on theory, writing, and critical thinking (At least 2 readings per week). Essays are the main assignments, but most of the time fairly short (1–2 pages); feedbacks are incredibly detailed. Active participation in class is required but it is a classroom where every input is welcomed."
,,,,,,,,,,,Child development and learning about the way child’s think.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is a really good option. It focuses on the applied aspects of human development (policy, learning, etc) more than the psychological aspects, which makes the course more diverse and interesting. However, if you've taken an intro psych class or anything on human development before this class will be a lot of repetition."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is super easy. The material gets somewhat repetitive and a little boring. The teacher is super nice and is passionate about what she teaches. The course is two pretty shorts essays and a final policy memo. There are a few discussions. Overall, light work load."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was nice how the final policy memo was scaffolded throughout the class. I do wish some of the theory about developmental was more in depth and less surface level. I appreciate how responsive Prof. Leneman was to the class, and she really tried to make it better and more interactive for everyone"
sesp,sesp,201,spring,Keira Leneman,5.12,4.47,4.06,3.82,4.59,3.71,I'm really interested in childhood development but honestly this course wasn't great. We didn't go into any depth on any of the content and I don't feel like I've learned very much.
,,,,,,,,,,,The teacher was great and very accommodating. Classes were always fun to be in.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class would be really nice for a freshman who hasn’t done much paper reading or writing recently. For anyone who has done any of that even sometime during the year, it can get pretty boring and “hand–holdy.” It is an easy A, though, with lots of opportunities for extra credit. Attendance at all the classes is required. The assignments all build on each other, so the final paper wasn’t stressful. Good class, glad I took it, it was just kinda boring."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great, chill class. I would recommend taking this class during freshman or sophomore year as a lot of time is spent on introductory skills. Over than that there is a lot of choice and extra credit opportunities which is nice. I would recommend this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not a bad class at all. Kiera is very kind and understanding, and promotes classroom development very well. I feel like most of the other students in class didn't really care to be there though, which made class and group discussions kind of dull. Assignments were fine and lots of chances to re–submit and get extra credit to boost your score. Fair class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very easy. Very repetitive and social science–y. Questions like ""What is a principle?"" and other arbitrary, extremely macro–level questions can get tiring."
,,,,,,,,,,,It allowed me to understand how children and adolescents develop
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this course a lot more than I though I would given the content. It was a very broad but surprisingly insightful view into human development, and I learned a lot. The class itself is structured specifically so you can succeed, and I found the assignments to be incredibly easy while also forcing me to reflect upon the content learned in lectures. Very good class overall."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a simple class. I think that it was kind of a boring class at least to me. The discussion questions in class were a bit confusing and I didn't really understand what she wanted us to say. But prof is super super nice and friendly. She is very flexible which I really appreciate because the quarter gets busy sometimes.
,,,,,,,,,,,Super easy class! Flexible and manageable with other courses. Not the most stimulating but if you need to get a requirement done it's a good fit.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a very good course. Dr. Leneman gives good lecture and keeps class engaging. You will learn a lot about developmental psychology, theory, and research."
,,,,,,,,,,,this course was interesting and was a good intro to the SESP course.

sesp,sesp,201,spring,Julia Honoroff,5.11,4.95,4.95,4.30,4.95,4.40,"The workload is pretty average. The class is mostly lectures and sometimes they get a bit boring. Also, Julia moves fast when she lectures so don't try to write everything on the slides down, she'll post them. Hope is an AMAZING TA and helps the papers feel less stressful."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Julia was a great professor – she was dynamic and put together interesting lectures. The papers we wrote throughout the quarter were very useful for the final, and it was not hard to have 100% going into the final. Subject matter was generally really interesting too."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was great for the LCO requirement, and the professor was really nice, knowledgable, and accommodating. Definitely take this option"
,,,,,,,,,,,"IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE 201 TAKE IT WITH JULIE (and Hope). SESP 201 is taught so many different ways, but Julie's class has to be one of the best. We covered the basic developmental frameworks and aspects of child development, but also were constantly encouraged to put our learnings into context, such as relating it to policy initiatives. Lectures were intentional, with engaging group discussions and activities, and a few guest lecturers who are not only experts in their field, but also great lecturers who made it a fun and interesting class. Grades were based on discussion posts (8 mandatory of 10) and a policy description, two short papers, and a final paper, which all build off of each other. Julie and Hope want to see you succeed and are very accessible in and outside of office hours. Seriously, this is what every class should feel like: engaging, meaningful, necessary, and fun."
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this class with Professor Honoroff! She was incredibly supportive in all facets and has a very easygoing teaching/leading style. She knew how to make relevant connections of content to our day to day lives and kept the class engaged by using media trends and just things GenZ would know. The class is weekly discussion posts and 3 papers total but the papers are not bad at all. The readings are pretty long but honestly interesting so much so that they go by quick. Highly recommend!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Julia and Hope are really nice and supportive. Class is not that much work–– there's readings and discussion posts for some classes, but not hard at all, as well as a few short papers (like 1–2 pages) and the final paper. Julia does a good job making class interactive and I really loved going to class–– it was a fun environment."
,,,,,,,,,,,Julia's the best. Super chill class with interesting content. Definitely one of the better professors for this course. Super valuable feedback and availability for office hours.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned so much from this class (more than a lot of my past classes) and I think it's because the instructor created such a low pressure environment (extremely welcoming too). I looked forward to going to class because I was interested and now I am more mindful of child development. The class was 2 weekly discussion posts, 2 essays and a final paper which are on a policy that YOU are interested in. AMAZING class with an AMAZING instructor and TA. I am thinking of doing one more SESP class now."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Julia and Hope are really really nice people, but Julia is a little too new to have her own lecture style yet. The entire quarter felt like she was trying to get through all the slides, instead of teaching us something concrete. She brought in a lot of guest lecturers – some of which were truly truly amazing, so I appreciated her doing that. The class really is not that much stress: all quarter working toward one final paper (broken down into four pieces due throughout the quarter), twice a week discussion posts, and some readings. I don't know how many people actually read anything in the class, but I tried my very best to stay engaged, and there really was not that much incentive to stay engaged. Given that I am a psych major, a lot of the content was repetitive to me, but it was still great to refresh on these concepts. I don't necessarily recommend taking this with Julia, but I also don't think there is too much of a downside – you can learn a lot, but that depends entirely on you."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was so much fun and interesting
sesp,sesp,203,fall,Regina Logan,5.65,5.15,4.80,4.40,5.35,5.20,"I loved this class!! Very much discussion based and a lot of table talk. Prof. Logan really wants to hear your input about how class is going and you get as much out of it as you put into it. Logan's ungraded approach made me more apt to contribute because we get to decide what ""high effort"" is for ourselves in the final grade reflection at the end of the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course helped me understand how adult development is central to development, as scholarly work is generally focused on childhood. I really enjoyed the opportunities we had to put theory into practice, particularly at the end with our interview project. The course was not too heavy on readings, and both the professor and TA made sure to adjust workload whenever they felt it was too much."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Logan and Cindy are so sweet and understanding.
,,,,,,,,,,,I learned a lot about adulthood development
,,,,,,,,,,,I really loved this course. I am an HDC major and this course connected what I was learning in my other HDC classes which I am extremely appreciate of.
,,,,,,,,,,,I cannot recommend this class enough. I learned so much and found the content to be quite relevant and applicable. Very moving class.
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof Logan made the class super chill and ungraded. I liked the aspect of just learning instead of focusing on grades.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is incredible! The topics are all so applicable to real life and each class was very engaging. It was never too overwhelming and the ungraded structure was helpful because it was very self–motivated. Professor Logan and Cindy are so sweet and understanding, too!"
,,,,,,,,,,,great course! very interesting and had very applicable assigbments (ex: got to interview grandparent). prof logan is awesome!
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is VERY interactive. I love that the teachers are mindful of students. She was definitely my favorite teacher at Northwestern (I'm a senior too)
,,,,,,,,,,,It was an okay course. A little slow and there could have a bit more engaging content but the professor and TA were great.
,,,,,,,,,,,The class is not overly stressful and the assignments are done in a way that keeps students interested
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class. Professor Logan genuinely cares about teaching students effectively without creating stress for them. The guest speakers/panels, the course material, and the class discussions made this class interesting and fun."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was really well organized and taught. I learned a lot more than I thought I would! Learning the theories and being able to apply them felt like an accomplishment come the end of the quarter!
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was ungraded, meaning that there are no grades until your final reflection. In that sense, it's pretty easy, but you do have to work hard on the assignments and participate in class if you want to prove that you deserve a good grade. You get out what you put into the class. Regina and Cindy were so amazing, you can genuinely ask them for help with anything. We had name tents which was helpful. They do a lot of ice breakers at the beginning of the quarter too. It's not difficult to succeed in this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Logan was able to effectively utilize real–life stories into our learning of the adult lifespan.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great experience with ungrading, milestones were interesting, readings could be long but not necessary to do"
sesp,sesp,203,winter,Regina Logan,5.28,5.06,4.83,4.39,5.11,4.56,I loved this course! It was mostly discussion based and focused on various stages of adulthood all the way up to death (we had a guest Death Doulas come in to talk to us). The milestone assignments were lengthy and tricky but thought–provoking and I loved the various creative options offered.
,,,,,,,,,,,"There were a couple of panels that was super cool: we got to talk with a panel of parents and grandparents in class, to talk about how adult development is like."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Super great, fun, chill class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Readings are dense, but some are definitely interesting. There are three major assignments, and in the end you give yourself a grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Adulthood and Aging with Professor Logan was a really good experience! I loved how the class was ""ungraded"", which allowed me to focus on my learning rather than my grades. Although Logan was occasionally disorganized and some classes were rushed toward the end, I still think I learned a lot. I can honestly say that I'm leaving this course with a better understanding of myself and those around me, which is always the goal in a human development course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was cool, especially if you want to learn more about aging or things that parents and elders go through. The workload is generally pretty light, other than a few group assignments and a final interview analysis that is pretty lengthy. I would recommend to go into this class with a group of people you want to work with, but if not that’s fine too. Class is “ungraded” so everything is labeled “Milestone #” instead of assignment or whatever. You will get a LOT of feedback, which is nice but a little bit over the top. I have had multiple classes with Prof. Logan and she is very sweet and experienced as a Prof. but sometimes is a little all over the place."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, I enjoyed this course because it made me question how I have developed and how I want to continue developing as an adult. I was also able to learn about three new theories and apply them to those close to me – something I found really cool and intriguing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was fairly easy but I still learned a lot about human development. Professor Logan is retiring so this class will probably change a lot. There were four assignments, a summary of the developmental theories basically, a presentation, a case study talking about the three developmental theories again, and then the final reflection (basically a summary of everything we learned). My main issue is that the middle of the class didn't line up with the readings so it was very unmotivating to actually do the readings. There were a lot of cool topics we covered in the middle that didn't have an assignment to them– I thought I honestly didn't learn a lot doing the presentation and wish we did something else. But overall, very little homework and Professor Logan is a super nice person."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was fine. the content was kinda repetitive but it was a pretty standard SESP class. Good mix of lecture, table discussions, group discussions. “Ungraded” aspect was new for me, and I’m not sure I liked it. Gina is pretty engaging as a prof, but I feel like it also depends how talkative your class is"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed the structure of this course, especially the three milestones. The class was ungraded, which took pressure off of grades. I felt that I could enjoy the course more because of that. I sincerely enjoyed interviewing an elder in my family, leading me to learn more about their life as a young adult."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Chill course learning about development during adulthood. This class is ""ungraded"" meaning rather than getting grades on our assignments, we get extensive feedback about what we did well or could improve on. At the end of the quarter, we have to do a final reflection and grade ourselves. Overall, the ungraded system was pretty chill and if you put in the work, you'll obviously do well. Besides that, the class was also really relaxed and I didn't ever feel too stressed or overwhelmed with the work. Not a lot of homework, the readings can get long and dense but I found that you don't really have to do all of them. Professor Logan is a really kind and understanding professor that cares about her students and genuinely wants us to learn and do well. Took this because it's a requirement for all SESP majors but would still recommend regardless of who you're studying."
,,,,,,,,,,,Gina is so cool! Awesome and knowledgeable professor. Nice communication.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Logan is great! This is her last time teaching this class, so I can't speak for how other instructors go about the subject, but she did a wonderful job making the literature applicable to real life. We got to talk to older adults as well as hear from a death doula, and then conduct our own interviews about adulthood and aging for a final project. For a requirement, it's a very manageable class."
sesp,sesp,204,winter,Danny Cohen,4.20,4.00,3.47,3.40,4.20,3.86,"Danny is a great and very kind person, but very chaotic as a professor. The class was way better paced in the beginning than in the end. The class consisted of twice–a–week journal entries, almost weekly creative sparks (a short writing piece), and a final project. The final project also had miscellaneous parts to it due at different points of the quarter. Danny dropped on us an almost 6000–word group assignment two weeks before it was due, and there was also a final self–reflection that was literally due after the entire class concludes. No reading was technically mandatory, and there are ways to get around the miscellaneous writing assignments. This class really doesn’t incentivize you to learn or to design a good final social program (which was the goal of the class). For a person who majored, studied, and practiced design, I was a little surprised to see how disorganized our Canvas page was. Danny was also very ambitious in what he wanted to achieve, and the class discussion frequently went in unexpected directions that deviated us from the core material. Danny would also address minor points for way too long just to get one point across. Not the best class, and not the worst class. Very manageable work at the end of the day. A fitting cluster course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very easy class, but there were a lot of little assignments to do. Overall an easy sesp class to take"
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this class. Professor Cohen and Ms. Morrisroe bring excellent ideas to the in–class conversations and are both very thoughtful of the content and students.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Summary: easy class, interesting discussions, work piles on at end"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Assignments: 2 journal entries a week, 1 ""creative spark"" a week, team design project assignments every couple of weeks, with final presentation, final paper, and final reflection. This class was really interesting and I actually enjoyed doing all of the weekly readings and felt they related to the class content really well. Sometimes class discussions were unengaging and most of the class was usually zoned out, but the topics we discussed were interesting. We didn't learn a lot about actually designing social programs outside of the team design project and we didn't even start that project until like Week 8 besides choosing our program topic. The class didn't require much work but because we didn't focus on the design project until the end of the quarter, a lot of the work piled on in the last two weeks when it could have been spread out among earlier weeks. I wish we had done more hands–on activities to make class time more engaging––Danny can kind of just ramble for a long time during his lectures, but he has actual experience in the fields he teaches about which makes the class really interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,Easy A. Take this class if you are in SESP for a degree or extension requirement. Not much outside work and Professor Cohen is chill.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course allowed me to learn about very important topic related to social change. However, I wish this course was taught by someone other than a white man."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a major requirement and it was okay, if you have a different opinion than the teacher or projective students its really hard to speak or participate in class discussions. Very liberal class."
,,,,,,,,,,,easyyyyyy SESP class. take this if you want a stress free classroom environment
,,,,,,,,,,,Really enjoyed this course. Danny and Alexis are an awesome duo that clearly care about creating a class that teaches students. Classes are pretty discussion based and also a team project. Highly recommend.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is so easy. Definitely take it if you're looking for an easy A to fill one of your clusters. We had a 300 word journal entry due after each class, a creative spark (idea for a social solution) due once a week, and a final group project that's definitely manageable. I did other homework during the class because our in–class discussions were pretty odd. Sometimes they were meaningful, but most of the time, professor Cohen treated us like elementary schoolers. I'm not complaining, because I really enjoyed coloring, but I don't think the course necessarily did what it was advertising."
sesp,sesp,210,winter,Clement Jackson,4.33,4.11,4.35,4.56,4.06,8.11,Data set processing
,,,,,,,,,,,Honestly a great and straightforward introduction to Stats. I appreciated every aspect of this course and found it very easy to follow.
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you like statistics, take the class, if not, then definitely don't. The Problem sets take FOREVER and are so long. The class said it would have 8 PSETS, but it had 9, and they would assign PSETS due on the same day as both the midterm and final."
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this class. Course load was manageable and very straight forward.
,,,,,,,,,,,Felt very unsupported by Professor Jackson. The course content can be difficult coming from a humanities major and Professor Jackson did not make it his responsibility to support his students with any extra help.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely a standard stats course, more SESP based. TA was awesome"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Maybe I'm just not a stats person. This class kicked my butt; the material simply intuitively didn't click in my brain, especially once we got to regression and confidence intervals. But the professor and TA were both very helpful and supportive. They did their best. I, unfortunately, had a miserable time. I'd recommend starting work early for each weekly assignment, rather than stalling until Sunday or Monday like most groups, and getting classmates' numbers to ask questions on confusing homework material. You'll be golden if you prepare correctly and structure your studying!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall this was a great course to take. This was my first statistics course (I am a first–year) and found it very manageable. If you do take this course try to take it with a friend. If you can form a group right away it will make this class much easier. You have weekly practice sets and checking them over with people is a necessity. They are worth 40% of your grade. Do the practice midterm and final because although the professor doesn't post an answer key, they are very similar to the actual midterm/final you'll receive."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would not take this class unless I absolutely had to. First each week you are required to complete a problem set. These problem sets would be helpful in solidifying ideas if 95% of the time was not spent trying to figure out how to do things on excel (which is not taught in lectures and not on any of the exams). In general, my group would spend about an hour doing the math problems and about an hour and a half trying to figure out the excel problems. I will say that the grading tends to be fairly lenient however this course will be incredibly frustrating if you do not know how to use excel."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Jackson moves very quickly through the course. Our TA Logan Fenimore was fantastic and made the course material easy to understand. Overall, I think this course was achievable considering its a math class at NU."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I cannot emphasize this enough: the WORST class I have taken at NU, and not because of the content, but because of Professor Jackson who is incredibly apathetic to the course and his students. He would rarely answer emails students would send him and was so hard to reach. He never attended his own office hours that he set. He was awful at explaining things in lecture and never really succinctly taught a concept. He could not recall any of our names, and the class was only 30 people. He altered the syllabus by giving an additional PSET without explaining how it will work into our grade and made it due the day of the final. Not to mention the PSETs were long and arduous, often taking nearly 10 hours a week to complete, especially since the TA was such a nit picky grader. The exams were horrendous and he gave no opportunity to review or go over them. This is a SESP Core class that should not by any means cause this amount of stress. Please avoid taking it with Professor Jackson if you can."
,,,,,,,,,,,Easiest stats class ever. It was literally easier than my AP Stats class in high school. Definitely recommend if you need to fill up any stats credit. The class is graded very lightly and the assignments and exam are pretty east. Super easy A.
,,,,,,,,,,,horribleeee class. take it with any other professor. Professor is very unavailable
sesp,sesp,218,fall,Josiah Rosario,6.00,6.00,5.88,5.75,6.00,3.00,"I love Leaders Lab! This is probably the best course you can take at Northwestern. The community you will find within this class is unmatched, and the material will push you further emotionally and intellectually. The teaching team ensures you feel safe, affirmed, and comfortable in the space. Very relaxing and generative grading/assignment policy as well. One final project on a community skillshare where everyone encourages and uplifts practices. All FGLI students should 1000% take this course. It positively changed my perspective on myself, others, and the world around me."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was the best class I have taken at Northwestern. Words can't describe how special this class was to me and I learned so much from being so vulnerable with my classmates. The content we covered in this course really changed the way I view the world and where I want to focus my energy! LOVED THIS CLASS 100/10
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course challenged me emotionally and academically in ways I could not imagine. Josiah, Vanessa, and the teaching team crafted this course to test my notion of education, and grateful it did because I have some many new ideas to challenge the status quo and improve the edu system."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Although we only met once a week, I enjoyed every class we had. We talked especially about working towards community justice and what it means to thrive in all aspects of being a student, a human being. I really appreciated the times we had guest speakers talk about their own experiences with the topics we were discussing in class. What we learned in this space was critical to my experience in other classes too. This class is unlike anything I have ever experienced before, and it grounded me in my dreams about what an educational experience can look like when students' voices are appreciated."
,,,,,,,,,,,Highly recommend and suggest. It is a way for students to form community and have people to lean on which was really nice during my first year. Cannot recommend this course enough.
,,,,,,,,,,,I was not prepared for how draining class would be. Not only is it a long class at the end of the week but a lot of the conversations can take a toll on your body in the best way possible.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is simply beautiful. I was able to express myself in a safe space, and I'm forever grateful that I was part of such an amazing community."
,,,,,,,,,,,LOVE LOVE LOVE this class. Please take it if you have the chance to. The teaching team is phenomenal. The class actually prioritizes you and your mental health and is genuinely fun. No stress at all when it comes to this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course helped me view education through a new lens. Leaders Lab invites you to imagine a world were your ideal learning environment exists, not setting for how things are currently, but dreaming of what it can be in the now. This was by far one of my favorite courses this quarter!"
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved the activities we engaged in in this class. They were fun and helpful to my learning. I wish more classes are like this.
,,,,,,,,,,,Take It!!! It is a great class that loves all of the peer leaders and instructors in charge of this program. I recommend you take this class if you are a first–generation and low–income student.
sesp,sesp,251,fall,Alex Gonzalez,5.86,5.67,5.71,4.71,6.00,3.00,This was probably one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Northwestern. I really enjoyed actually being able to leave the Northwestern 'bubble' and make connections across the broader community.
,,,,,,,,,,,"So far, this course has been such an incredible experience. Not only are the advisors fully engaged and passionate about the topics covered in class, but the students are also determined to participate and be the best mentors they can be for their mentees. The required readings were incredibly interesting and powerful, and they tied well to the social or intrapersonal issues we might encounter during this experience. Overall, it has been such a positive opportunity."
,,,,,,,,,,,Loved the class component of this program and the weekly readings/podcasts were easily integrated and very helpful with our work with the mentees.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The Cities Project is such a unique opportunity here at NU to give back to our Chicago community. You build such a great connection with the professors, your fellow mentors, and the students you work with. Though you don't learn as much about educational equity as I thought you would, you do gain a good sense of the Chicago school system and mentoring skills."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed the class component to the Cities Project because it allowed me to learn more about how to be a good mentor and supported my mentorship throughout our meetings with the middle schoolers. Before we started our mentoring sessions, the class would start with an icebreaker activity to get closer with the other mentors. Then, we would discuss our readings, which were topics such as basics of mentoring or cultural humility. Once the mentoring sessions started, class time was used to practice what we would do during our session, discuss logistics, and acted as a space to ask questions."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Willie, Alex, and Gretchen are very kind, caring, and helpful! They did a great job of leading the program and providing us support."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is excellent. I recommend you to be part of the Cities Project if you are interested in mentorship and want to educate yourself more about the struggle children have to go through in low–income communities. This was a great course, and I enjoyed working with the team. I learned so much from every single one of them."
sesp,sesp,251,winter,Alex Gonzalez,6.00,5.83,5.67,5.50,6.00,3.67,The Cities Project Mentoring sessions have been enjoyable. I have learned so much about mental health and youth mentoring through these sessions.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I love this class so much — this is one of the few opportunities Northwestern students have to actually interact with and make a difference in the surrounding community. Willie, Gretchen and Alex are the best!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I love that I was able to continue my participation in this incredible program for yet another quarter. Willie, Alex and Gretchen are incredible mentors to all of us, and I feel like the group has become very close. It's amazing to see how the mentees and mentors have become more comfortable with each other, which has made the weekly sessions so much more fun!"
,,,,,,,,,,,The Cities Project is such a valuable experience for anyone looking to go into education or nonprofit work/research. Highly recommend.
sesp,sesp,251,winter,Ruben Echevarria,5.92,5.50,5.31,4.85,5.83,3.92,This course allowed me to spend time thinking about what mattered to me and focus on finding something meaningful to do during the summer.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Though a large part of the class was about finding internships as opposed to specific methods for crafting cover letters, app responses, interviewing practices, etc., I found small moments to be enlightening, particularly when it came to the guest speakers who came to share about their experiences and give advice, and when we touched on financial stuff (i.e. what to do with your money)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"One of the best classes I've taken here. Super practical information that you'd normally have to go digging for yourself. The class is designed to set you up with very helpful resources.

It helped us find applications for statistics beyond what the reading materials suggested."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The encouraging environment to attach course concepts to our real life experiences produced really meaningful and insightful conversations. The individuals who took part in this class specialize in different disciplines so this was especially nice considering each of us was able to provide different perspectives on the same topics, allowing for intriguing discussions."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very chill class for a formal studies distro. No actual math required you read two books (one is a comic book), submit notes weekly, and have to do one presentation which is super chill. Also Dr.Peel is amazing. Definitely would recommend if you are looking for a low effort but fun/engaging class."

sesp,sesp,251,spring,,,,,,,,This is one of the best courses I have taken at NU so far. Everyone on the teaching team is extremely knowledgeable and welcoming. It was great being able to engage with ETHS students. I learned a lot about education and the steps to designing educational spaces.
sesp,sesp,251,spring,,,,,,,,"I didn't know what to expect from this class, especially since this was my first SESP class, but overall I think it was a nice experience. The integration of ETHS and NU students was a cool aspect of the class, and we always got to collaborate with each other throughout the entire class. I think my issue with the class was that the objectives were not very clear. The pedagogical team was an interesting approach to the class, but I also think having that many people lead the class made it difficult to follow along with lectures, assignments, and the direction of the course generally. Language was a key part of the class, and we learned about a lot of theoretical approaches to education, but it eventually became repetitive and I didn't have any takeaways other than that. I also think because there weren't clear objectives or a clear structure to the class, the three–hour weekly meeting time was hard. I think if you are learning about justice in education, this is a good class for you to exercise your ideas in that realm, but if not, I don't think this class would be enjoyable."
sesp,sesp,251,spring,,,,,,,,This is such a great course and definitely recommend to everyone. All of the instructors are passionate about the topic and it's seen through their efforts in connecting with students. It's an ETHS combined course so there are a wide range of ideas coming from various grade levels and ages.
sesp,sesp,251,spring,,,,,,,,"Dinner is provided, you get to work/interact with Evanston high school students, it's more than just reading assignments, and the teaching team is the best. At times the 3 hour runtime may bog down on you, especially on a Wednesday evening, but staying awake is the only thing you need to power through. Discussions can be very engaging and stimulating."
sesp,sesp,251,spring,,,,,,,,"This course was different. I was able to learn from high school students about education and create my own thoughts by being in computer with others. I was given space to dream and imagine. It was also amazing we actually did meaningful work and make design projects to impact our community. I enjoyed the food that was provided, and that we had time to eat/chat together. I did think the class was too long at times."
sesp,sesp,251,spring,,,,,,,,"I went into this class with really high expectations, and while I enjoyed some of the discussions in my annotation groups and the content of the readings, I, unfortunately, did not have the best experience in this group. It largely felt very unstructured, and there were assignments that were added and assigned with very little instruction, and this was all confusing. I think my experience in my design group had a lot of areas for improvement. The discussions in class were at times unproductive and long, and at the end, it was mostly just me and one other person in my group working on the slides, even though we all had to present in the end. I also felt like the space wasn't a place where I could share my ideas without always facing constructive feedback. I understand that constructive feedback can be very valuable at the right time and place, but I don't know if hearing this kind of feedback after almost every statement I made helped me learn and this at times felt punitive. I did appreciate the dinner which I thought allowed for some capacity of community–building, but I still left the class not really knowing who was in the class with me, and I wish there was a way for us to share each of stories and get to know the other people in the class. The other part of this class that impacted me was the length. Having a 3–hour class on a Wednesday night was difficult after having a long day of classes and it was hard to stay focused on what we were doing in class."
sesp,sesp,251,spring,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot from the pieces in the course. It's always a green flag when adrienne marie brown & bell hooks are in the syllabus. There's also always dinner, which is a huge plus! I loved the like–minded faculty and people I met. The overall ideas and theories within this class were great. However, at times the course struggled with practicing those ideas of educational justice, or at least what I consider them to be. In a class on educational justice, I would've appreciated more of a ""process over product"" approach in assignments and less elementary student ""management” strategies. The course moved extremely fast at times, and it felt like management was prioritized rather than just doing what was generative for students' learning. I also feel like there needs to be more space for holding students’ stories and experiences, as a few aspects of the course are more intellectualized and not felt with sensitivity/emotion. We also talked a lot about rejecting traditional student–and–teacher relationships, but it felt like those thoughts were never transferred over into the course curriculum as many classes were lecture–style and rushed group meetings. Yet, the teaching team has good intentions, and every SESP student interested in education should definitely take this class. While I have my critiques, I still overall recommend the course!"

sesp,sesp,272,fall,Amanda Peel,5.06,5.06,4.56,4.06,4.78,5.17,"This class is pretty easy. It is a group research project that adds onto itself week by week. There isn't a lot of structure, so it is important for your group to be people who want to take initiative in what they are doing. As long as you finish the assignments with a decent attention to detail and show your willingness to learning, you should be able to get a good grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a little broad, we had too much room to come up with research that it became difficult to know what we were supposed to be doing. The class itself was a little dull, although the material isn't inherently boring. Some of the homework feels like busywork but the class is easy to do well in."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was simple enough as prior CTEC's mentioned but it was also so full of information, I really felt that I learned something every class and that I was practicing what I was learning every class."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really liked the ungraded structure of this class because it took a lot of the pressure off. Dr. Peel is really kind and a good teacher. The readings were also super reasonable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Field Research Methods is one of those kinds of core classes that you just have to get over, but if you're able to take it with Professor Peel, I highly recommend it! She uses materials that are very easily digestible (we had a graphic novel as our main reading), and if the concepts got too abstract or difficult to understand at times, she was always extremely nice and approachable/willing to answer any questions we had. The observations (4 hours across the quarter) were also pretty interesting and fun to do, and I enjoyed the ability to work with people that I wanted to in a group – the class would have been unenjoyable otherwise. The class was also ungraded, which really allowed us to learn for the sake of learning, if anything, and it made it very stress–free."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The professor is super nice. I loved the ungraded system, I thought it really helped me focus on learning rather than grades."
,,,,,,,,,,,"After taking this class, expect to have a solid understanding of the foundations of qualitative research theory and methods. Prof. Peel did a great job in structuring the curriculum lectures and providing assignments that allowed us to practice what we learned. The material may sometimes feel boring, but it's still important to learn about the qualitative side of research as opposed to just the quantitative."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was really fun!
,,,,,,,,,,,Amazing course that helps you think outside the standard quantitative methods of research. Highly recommend!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Decent course. Not too taxing in terms of course load. Do the work, and you'll be fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was more challenging than I expected it to be. I feel as if some assignments were unnecessarily long. I also feel like instructions were often unclear on assignments. For example, we had a final presentation that we did as a group and then we had a writeup that was individual although we developed our grounded theory as a group."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was pretty boring but not hard at all. I took it because it's required for people in SESP. It's ungraded so there's less stress on that end, but you still need to submit good work. As long as you keep up with assignments and attend class (attendance was tracked and part of grade) you'll be fine. Assignments are mostly weekly journals and group work. Prof. Peel and Shai were as helpful as they could be but some of the info was just very new to us so it took my group a little while to figure out what we were doing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor and TA both super nice and understanding with extensions and the learning process with a course that is so different from all other courses. Lecture could be a bit boring at times, but there was also a lot of time to work and think in class rather than out of class which was nice. Wish there was a little bit more help in terms of grouping people together (ended up with just 1 partner while other groups had 5, and a more even split could have been useful). Also wish there was a peer evaluation at the end."
sesp,sesp,272,fall,Christopher Leatherwood,5.53,4.27,4.33,4.27,5.20,5.41,Take this class with Professor Leatherwood! It's low stress. Assignments and the final paper involve your group studying a space on campus. Field note observations and interview transcription assignments can be tedious but not difficult. Prof was also receptive to our feedback and eliminated the weekly discussion posts halfway through the quarter.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Course takes up a lot of time outside of class, but professor is very accommodating."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I love Professor Netherwood, but this course is a lot of busy work. Do not take it if it is not a major or minor requirement."
,,,,,,,,,,,I thought the course was not helpful for any of my objectives
,,,,,,,,,,,"DR LEATHERWOOD IS THE BEST. TAKE THIS COURSE/ANY COURSE W HIM. Especially methods, he is very passionate and caring, and truly lectures like no other at NU"
,,,,,,,,,,,CHRIS IS THE GREATEST PROFESSOR EVER. He is clearly so passionate about the topic of research and LOVES teaching. I had no interest in the subject and he got me excited about it. He cares so much about the student experience and takes our feedback very seriously. You HAVE to take this class with Chris.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Leatherwood is great; the discussions are great and he is so receptive to student feedback. He asks us what we're thinking and really takes it into consideration. He also likes to question us when we assert things, and at first it's a little strange, but I think it's refreshing! I really enjoy him as a professor, and encourage students to take the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class looked daunting, especially with a group project that was completed throughout the whole quarter. However, this course was fun and lighthearted. Professor Leatherwood is extremely accommodating."
,,,,,,,,,,,It’s a requirement. Prof Leatherwood is super cool and very nice. I’d say with this class take it with a professor that you like since that will make the difference
,,,,,,,,,,,"It is clear that Professor Leatherwood is incredibly passionate about the subject in the class, which enhances the learning experience in the class. He is also clearly interested in including student input in how the class is organized."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really liked how there were a lot of team/group projects
,,,,,,,,,,,"I mean this class is a SESP requirement so there's not much to say. I'm personally not super interested in ethnographic field work, so this class felt a bit like a chore at times. I still don't understand why this course is required, and it felt super disconnected from all of my other SESP content."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Leatherwood is pretty good.
,,,,,,,,,,,"given that you have to take this course as a sesp requirement, there is not much you can do. but I really, really hated this course and it was one of the worst I've taken in all of college. Chris is super understanding and cool, but there was just wayyyy too much work. if you aren't interested in the subject (which I wasn't), I would suggest finding an easier professor who gives less work."
sesp,sesp,272,winter,Briellen Griffin,5.79,5.47,5.40,5.14,5.64,3.53,"Loved this class and professor Griffin. This class should be mandatory for everyone, finally helped to fill the gaps on writing research papers or conducting any type of research. A new found appreciation and understanding. Well done professor!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Nice Professor, grading is fair and low time commitment for the most part"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Griffin is the BEST! It's hard to make a research methods class interesting, but she does a great job of engaging students and helping us learn. I recommend taking this class with Dr. Griffin if you have to take it for SESP req."
,,,,,,,,,,,"if you can, take this class with Prof Griffin, she is the best!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Griffin is awesome. She truly wants you to learn and makes research interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Amazing class, even more amazing professor. Work actually makes sense and can be applicable in real life. Dr. Griffin truly cares about your well–being and that you learn something in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Griffin is the best. She made this class so engaging. Going into it, I thought it would be a repeat of what I've learned in other classes, but it was not. We learned about new approaches to research and I learned to look at research in a whole new way. Throughout the quarter you focus on a research topic of your choice, so it makes the actual assignments interesting because it's a topic you choose."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Griffin is awesome
sesp,sesp,272,winter,Lilah Shapiro,5.67,5.06,5.06,4.83,5.56,5.67,This class is an interesting introduction to observational research and research through interviews. I appreciated the readings that we did and found the discussions about the readings to be interesting. I enjoyed the final interview project. Occasionally the pace of the class was slow but I would recommend it as a whole.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was ok but very often it just felt like rich white folks speaking on behalf of marginalized people and thinking that they are soooo different from other rich white people. Instead of highlighting that bad research is everywhere and you could be unintentionally doing it, I felt that our class was structured to think that we are the ""good"" ones and we would never conduct ""bad"" research. There were certainly opportunities for self–criticism but only reviewing your own work can yield a limited amount of fruit. Our class discussions were not really interesting or productive, but mostly because of SESP in general and not the class itself. It irked me that my classmates were so afraid of defending readings that Prof Shapiro would preface as ""bad"" research. The culture within SESP to always agree with each other stultifies our critical thinking skills. I would love to see people respectfully disagree or grapple with each other’s ideas more freely. But I'm also contributing to this culture so who am I to criticize... In the future I hope that Prof Shapiro does not insert her opinion on the readings before we read them. This might prevent students from not having preconceived notions and intentionally seeking out elements in the reading. I would also appreciate it if she created more space for students to just…. think on their own. Wait time / thinking time is not a bad thing!! Discussions about the readings sometimes did not feel like discussions. It was 40% students talking and 60% Prof. Shapiro talking. Melanie the TA was great."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is a lot of work but the work is all very relevant and helpful. If you are going to do research at all in the future or read any kind of research (which everyone does) this class is very helpful. Lilah is amazing as always and the best professor at NU. Take this class or any class with her because she is the best.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a SESP requirement, so I would recommend taking it with Shapiro. She is so kind and genuinely cares about her students. She took the time to go through all of the materials carefully. This class does have a good amount of work, but it is not difficult. She made sure to give us time in class to complete much of our work. All of the readings we had were truly interesting and I enjoyed discussing them in the class. At the end of the quarter, you end up grading yourself."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Lilah is such a wonderful human being. Methods with her is significantly more work than with other professors (I believe). I intentionally took it with her because she is very meticulous with her teaching and has a curricular emphasis on interviewing. For someone who wants to go into research or do a thesis project, taking methods with Lilah is definitely a very good choice. She is super super understanding. The class was all out of completion grades with self–grading/self–assessment. The assignments included 3 field observations + field notes, and one final interview project that encompassed 2 interviews and open–coding for those interviews. If you wish to learn field methods, take it with Lilah – she is amazing at what she does and a great thinker! If you just want to cruise by and get the credit, maybe with somebody else."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely recommend taking this class with Lilah! She's an amazing professor and our class discussions were always really engaging. Our TA Melanie was also the best and so nice. Grades were mostly for completion and with an emphasis on growth, so as long as you do your best and integrate any feedback they give you, you'll be fine. There is a lot of writing for this class, but it's not too hard as long as you take your time with it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"the course was super interesting and fun. it was a little time consuming sometimes, but fine if you start your work early and don't fall behind. lilah is also a great instructor and super sweet"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty easy and manageable class. You work in groups the whole time and submit a final project at the end (final presentation). You do 2 observations, 2 interviews and 1 final presentation."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great course! Lots of work tho
,,,,,,,,,,,"this course definitely introduced me to topics in field research in depth. i think that the final project was also effective in applying lessons from the course to real life in a very thoughtful and stimulating manner. while i did enjoy the course overall, i do think there were very lengthy readings that sometimes just repeated what previous readings had said"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course it really great! Professor Shapiro is really passionate about helping us learn and practice the use of ethnography and interviewing. I especially found her feedback on our work really helpful, and as long as you put the work into this class you can do very well!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was a really great way to delve into the realm of qualitative research and analysis. Taking it with Professor Shapiro was awesome!
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed reading various ethnographies, and class discussions"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm glad this class is a SESP requirement because I definitely learned a lot. I loved SESP 200 with Lilah, and she did not disappoint with SESP 272. The class definitely had a lot of work, although I wouldn't call it busy work. All of the assignments felt very meaningful and had an overarching purpose for the learning objectives. We had a few readings throughout the quarter that were pretty long, but some of them were super interesting and they read like a novel rather than an academic paper. The class was ungraded, which allowed for flexibility and definitely eased stress. I heard that other professors assigned less work, so take that as you will. I definitely recommend taking the class with Lilah, though. And Melanie, our TA, was also amazing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Field methods is a requirement for SESP, would not recommend taking it if you do not absolutely need to. The workload is on and off. I really like Lilah (Prof. Shapiro), but the topics of this class were not super engaging. The beginning of the quarter is lighter with a few readings and then the end of the quarter really piles up and there are generally multiple time–consuming assignments due for any given week."
sesp,sesp,272,spring,Amanda Peel,4.90,4.18,4.09,3.77,4.35,4.82,Professor Peel is awesome! you can tell she has a longstanding passion for field methods and that's what makes her teaching so great. Her knowledge on everything makes her feedback on assignments so precise and helpful. She is also very encouraging as a person which makes me feel good about the class and my performance. Love!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class, not a lot of work, and interesting subject!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this class! The workload is quite light (a big chunk of each class is dedicated to teamwork), and all the work throughout the quarter builds towards the final project. Prof Peel is very kind and down–to–earth, but sometimes her lectures can be a bit repetitive of the reading. Overall, you will learn the basics of field research methods. Pick a good team!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Chill class, not hard if you put in some work. It's a heavily group–based class, so just make sure you get a GOOD GROUP."
,,,,,,,,,,,Try to stay on track and you'll be good.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I struggled to stay engaged in this class, and I felt like there are ways to make the instruction periods more engaging for the students. I didn't think the assignments outside of class were too challenging as long as you do the readings, but the readings could be long and dense at times and were not always explained fully in class. I was also overwhelmed by how much there was to do in the last two weeks in the quarter, and it's really important that you choose a good, focused group to make sure you stay on track."
,,,,,,,,,,,"For a required SESP course, this course was a good one. Creating my ethnography with a group of my choosing was honestly pretty fun, and the course's ""ungraded"" method took the pressure off individual assignments so I had the opportunity to focus on my learning. This course doesn't have much work, you really don't need to do the readings, and you'll even learn a thing or two."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Class was kind of slow and unengaging at times. Class lectures would just summarize the readings––very well, but it made reading in advance seem pointless since it was alll recapped. Dr. Peele seems very kind and chill though! There wasn't much to do in the class until the last 3 weeks. In comparison, I heard the other section with a different instructor brought in guest speakers and made the pace of class more upbeat. Dr. Peele was very accomodating and the ungraded format makes it less stressful throughout."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course felt like a pretty standard class. It wasn't bad but it wasn't super engaging either. I liked the ungraded nature because I could focus on learning about research instead of worrying about my grade.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I came to this class thinking that it might be boring, but the professor really tried to make the course engaging. I really love the textbook and my project team!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"For me, this class got boring and uninteresting really fast. It is a required course, so I just championed through it, but it was difficult as the material for my group project was very dull. However, to bypass this: make sure you pick a very interesting topic you're passionate about for your project and get together a good group. Your experience in this class is what you make of it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"this class was a lot of work and was pretty annoying. you have to do all your work in a group and if other members don't contribute, you have a lot more to do. i would take another research methods class if possible."
sesp,sesp,272,spring,Regina Logan,5.75,5.25,5.40,4.95,5.58,4.60,"This was a great course. It was not difficult or time–consuming at all but I still learned so much. I really, really would recommend you take this freshman or sophomore year, as this course has truly shown me the different types of research and how you can research basically anything you are interested in or have a passion for in a way that is not just graphs and numbers."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is an “ungraded” course which took a lot of the stress off. The work we did was interesting, with a group research project at the end. Professor Logan is very kind and enthusiastic."
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this class! Gina is amazing and I learned so much!
,,,,,,,,,,,"AMAZING CLASS!!!! You will do exactly what is promised: you will learn how to complete an ethnography. Through concrete application of course concepts to your own chosen research site, you will figure ethnography out through hands–on practice. Super fun class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Amazing class and amazing professor.
,,,,,,,,,,,SUPER chill class but also relevant and fun
,,,,,,,,,,,great class but make sure to pace yourself in terms of finishing assignments. the professor does self–grading so it's best to put your best foot forward.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Logan taught this course so well. I loved being able to take this course and learn how to properly observe like a researcher. The readings were essential in the success of this class, and I really liked how the course was designed to help you succeed for the final project."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class. I really dislike research, but the content is not as heavy as one may assume. Professor Logan and our fantastic TA Fortunate were great assets to this class. This class is ungraded so a lot more accountability falls on you and your group. Take this class if you are at all interested in research, it really gives you many alternate options and perspectives."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall good course, kinda what you put in you will get out. The ungraded aspect made it easy to actually enjoy the process of learning, and none of the assignments were too strenous. Getting field notes done can be a bit challenging, but she is aware of this and doesn't make you do too many and gives you helpful and positive feedback."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great course
,,,,,,,,,,,The course went well. I thought it was interesting observing and taking field notes.
sesp,sesp,291,fall,Marina Micari,5.27,4.72,4.25,3.69,5.24,3.32,"Its a requirement, just make sure to leave comments and submit assignments on time."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course helped me learn how to become a better peer leader. However, it is more than that. You learn about many different aspects of equity and how to establish such. In addition, you are exposed to different perspectives and ideas. Amazing course!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not bad, just needed to remind myself to stay on top of my assignments. Was helpful to read the discussion board posts that other peer leaders wrote."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great
,,,,,,,,,,,"It is amazing what this course offers in such a short time. Spending time on the readings, even longer than is perhaps necessary, could be helpful just to absorb all the ways that we can improve as facilitators, and add new methods for learnign to each session."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a good course and provides support for peer leaders to develop teaching skills. I think there was the right amount of work as this was not time consuming but supplemented peer leading.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is not too difficult or time consuming. It's completely manageable with your schedule so I wouldn't be scared about this course being an extra burden. It's also pretty informative too, you learn some good strategies about leading your peer groups/helping people."
,,,,,,,,,,,Videos and material was interesting
,,,,,,,,,,,Pretty straightforward assignments and everything is related to your role as a PGSG leader.
,,,,,,,,,,,Ok run
,,,,,,,,,,,Give some useful tools and concepts to apply to my PGSG.
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was not too difficult and I think the workload was reasonable. Some of the assignments are repetitive and maybe unnecessary, but my experience in general was positive."
,,,,,,,,,,,NA
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course material and readings weren’t very helpful and kind of repetitive and common sense, but I enjoyed the observation portion."
,,,,,,,,,,,An enriching addition to being a PGSG leader
,,,,,,,,,,,The course is quite easy going
,,,,,,,,,,,Very low stress and I genuinely feel like I learned a few things that are useful both in PGSG and outside of it.
,,,,,,,,,,,The course does not help learning much. It feels like busy work. The content is also dry and not interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course seems like busy work at first, but it opens your eyes to some important academic and social themes that we overlook."
,,,,,,,,,,,It was great
,,,,,,,,,,,Learning from other's experiences was useful for me to improve the way I teach.
,,,,,,,,,,,I really liked the discussions via canvas with other leaders
,,,,,,,,,,,I appreciated the professional development session and the insight it provided in leading student sessions.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course felt very in–genuine. It just felt like a course so Northwestern can say ""we train our peer leaders so well"". I don't think it helped anyone and was some busy work. I liked that it was hybrid and everyone could do it at their own time, however, I wish it actually added something to my personal growth or gave me practical advice for my study groups."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Honestly, this class is really unnecessary. You don't learn anything, and it's just a burden of one more thing you have to do for a PGSG job. Easy A, just don't forget to attend a development session before the end of the quarter!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I had prior experience in teaching, but I had never taken a class on it. I enjoyed learning the granular of some tactics that I already used in the classroom, in addition to updating my current strategies. Overall, I felt as if this course was relevant to what I was doing."
,,,,,,,,,,,Simple class that outlines some of the qualities that tutors should have for their students while keeping in mind the diverse student body we have here at Northwestern.
,,,,,,,,,,,Easy course that's meant to encourage your introspection as an academic leader. Assignments are asynchronous and sporadic.
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was nice. I didn't learn too much more than I already knew, but putting myself in a space to actively discuss some of these issues made it easier to navigate my role as a peer leader."
,,,,,,,,,,,I think the course focused on material important for trying to help students engage better in their study groups.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course is relatively easy, there are few assignments, and they are pretty simple to complete as well. The readings can be kinda long but it isn;t too bad compared to some other classes"
sesp,sesp,291,fall,Marina Micari,5.20,4.76,4.14,3.68,4.80,3.18,"This is a very manageable course, I only had to think about it every few weeks and it didn't add any stress to my plate. The readings/modules are pretty interesting and super relevant to peer tutoring."
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,"If you're taking this course for ASLA, it's really easy and takes very little time. Try to get stuff out of the way early."
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,"Fine if you have to take it, I just had to set reminders in my calendar to remember to do the assignments. Overall though they didn't take that long/were relatively painless."
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,There were only a few reading assignments and discussion posts throughout the quarter. They were pretty long and kind of annoying while you're doing them but overall not too bad
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,This class was ok. It is a requirement for the Peer Guided Study Group and is not the worst class I've taken. Not a lot of work.
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,This course was required to be an ASLA tutor. Each of the three major assignments took about an hour.
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,Not too much work.
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,"This course was low time–commitment, and reading materials were genuinely useful for some aspects of my peer leadership. Assignments are mostly readings and responses, with a few in–person events thrown in as well. Overall, you can get as much out of the course material as you want to."
sesp,sesp,291,fall,Marina Micari,5.00,4.16,3.82,3.32,4.75,3.00,Helped me understand strategies for dealing and working with students during my tutoring sessions. Very chill and flexible course
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,I had anticipated loathing the assignments for this class but I actually enjoyed the reads!
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,"It's really frustrating that we have to take this course to be a peer tutor, but luckily it's barely any work."
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,Low work load and all assignments are actually relevant. I loved the professional development session and some of the videos were very interesting :)
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,"Very chill, low–stress course. If you complete the assignments on time you will do well. The expectations for this course are very clear from the beginning. Put in 20 mins per assignment and you'll be fine."
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,Takes little to no time at all.
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,"so much fun! Such a fun break in my day to come home, read some teaching theory, and think about how to be a better tutor."
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,"This course is very little work and very lowkey. If you complete the readings and think a little deeply about how they apply to your tutoring, you'll be able to actually learn something and you'll definitely get a good grade. The only purpose of this class is to improve tutoring practices, and I think that was accomplished pretty well. Sometimes it can be a bit of a pain to complete the readings and refer to them in your discussions, but it was never more than like an hour a week."
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,Discussion and feedback was helpful.
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,"This class is required for ASLA peer–tutoring. It only requires about 20 minutes of work a week, and you get an A as long as you complete all the work with reasonable effort. It was pretty helpful to learn about effective tutoring and communication styles."
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,Easy and low stress
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,Just make sure you do the assignments on time. Your assignments consist of doing readings and submitting reflections on them.
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,"Fine course if you have to take it. All online, minimal commitment. But you need to take an in–person seminar on a select topic."
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,"Course is based on three discussion posts in response to different sets of readings, an observation of another tutor, and a few other small assignments. Provides a lot of resources for you as a tutor but it's kind of up to you to apply this knowledge."
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,Learned a decent amount about the research around teaching
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,Just make sure to do the assignments on time; there aren't many.
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,"The materials presented in this asynchronous course supplemented our tutoring very well. It felt like a check–up throughout the quarter, which I really liked, to make sure we kept in mind some of the ways in which we could provide the best tutoring possible."
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,"A nice light workload course to boost your GPA, also learned something along the way so that is nice!!"
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,kind of seems like a useless course... not sure why there is a course for tutoring. I feel like it felt useless. Maybe just reflections but not the readings
,,,,Marina Micari,,,,,,,"This class is fine. It's required to be a peer tutor with a pretty light workload. Mostly some readings and Canvas posts. If you do the readings, you'll learn some valuable information but nothing ground–breaking. It's straightforward for the job, but it can feel like busy work. Nothing supplements being on the job itself. Might be more helpful to have a curriculum guided by NU tutors."
sesp,sesp,291,winter,Marina Micari,5.29,4.56,4.09,3.97,5.07,3.00,"While some of the course content felt just like common sense, I did learn a lot and I think it helped in my tutoring practices. The stress–free format of the class made it conducive to really thinking about what I was reading about and learning so that I could apply it to my tutoring."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was nice! Valerie Wolf is incredibly kind and it is a pleasure to work with her.
,,,,,,,,,,,"You gotta do it cuz ur a peer tutor. just like 292–1, more reading sets and an observation. not much work, just gotta do some writing every few weeks."
,,,,,,,,,,,the content and execution of the course was helpful in allowing me to be a better peer leader.
,,,,,,,,,,,Course seems pointless. Do the assignments and you should be fine.
,,,,,,,,,,,This class feels like annoying busy work that does not teach you anything. Actually hated doing these assignments and everyone just fakes them.
,,,,,,,,,,,This course offered good techniques to be a better tutor.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Readings were a little repetitive from last quarter, but otherwise a fine class"
,,,,,,,,,,,pretty similiar to last quarter. the responses are a little longer
sesp,sesp,291,winter,Marina Micari,4.83,4.40,4.05,3.26,4.60,3.00,"This class was okay. Much of it felt like busy work. My biggest complaint is that all of the deadlines feel very random, and the teachers only give reminders a week before each deadline. Thus, it's very easy to forget about the assignments and their deadlines and lose points off of late submissions."
,,,,,,,,,,,Honestly just feels like busy work. The word counts were excessively high
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is a great course and if you're taking this you're probably a peer–leader. It exposes you to new ideas that you may have been unfamiliar with and is overall interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's fine, just required to be in PGSG. Low commitment, a couple of assignments, nothing that time consuming."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think the course was very low commitment, however I reaped a lot of benefits from completing the course. The course material lwas easily digestible however had important key ideas to know and apply to in real life."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is more or less an extension of the first quarter of Sesp 291. There are three 600–800 word reading responses as well as the typical professional development session and peer observation assignments. Not too much of a time commitment.
,,,,,,,,,,,The course was similar to the prior quarter.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty much exactly the same as part I of this course. As long as you answer all questions on the assignments and make sure to get them in on time, you'll do well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is easy, you just need to stay on top of your work. It actually can be helpful with giving you ideas for your peer session."
sesp,sesp,291,winter,Marina Micari,5.03,4.59,4.18,3.53,4.97,3.20,Similar to the first quarter class.
,,,,,,,,,,,This course isn’t a lot of work but gives some super helpful information.
,,,,,,,,,,,I think that the texts and materials provided in the course didn't provide much new information or insight into what I could provide for my students in terms of support or learning strategies.
,,,,,,,,,,,The course was helpful in terms of expanding the teaching strategies I used in my study sessions.
,,,,,,,,,,,Assignments are like busy work and it's hard to balance this can sometimes feel like another whole class during busy parts of the quarter
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not time consuming, reasonable, similar structure as previous quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,Good asynchronous class!
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked it. Not demanding at all, yet it added value to my experience as a Peer–Guided Study Group Leader and peer mentor."
,,,,,,,,,,,it was nice to reflect on my growth as a PGSG facilitator
,,,,,,,,,,,Seriously the biggest waste of my time. Selling surface level material as “deep reflections” is all this class is
,,,,,,,,,,,I think this course was very manageable and has helpful material for understanding how to be an educator.
,,,,,,,,,,,Assignments are really easy and just make you reflect on your experiences.
,,,,,,,,,,,Good course
,,,,,,,,,,,Chill class. Let's you find new ways to better lead your PGSG group while not being too burdensome on other classes.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Required course for PGSG leaders. It's an easy course where you can get assignments done every 2–3 weeks or so. Didn't do much in challenging my previous thoughts or actions. I think it was mostly trying to remind (more privileged) students that other students struggle and have different backgrounds. Important, but kind of boring for the students who live it I guess. Not expecting much from a 0.25 credit course though."
,,,,,,,,,,,pretty ez
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked the videos that I had to watch. I liked the readings a bit less. Then the writings were probably the most time–consuming part of the whole unit, but overall, great class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Good classes
,,,,,,,,,,,Easy and beneficial
,,,,,,,,,,,Same as 291–1
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class wasn't too high–maintenance, and easy to get an A, but I do wish we were compensated with a little more than 0.25 credits for writing 3 essays."
,,,,,,,,,,,Felt repetitive.
,,,,,,,,,,,Good information about leading. Didn't take too much time.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was not particularly interested in the topics presented, although I understand how they may be helpful for other leaders"
,,,,,,,,,,,How to be good leader
,,,,,,,,,,,Just have to take it. Sometimes engaging.
sesp,sesp,298,fall,Sahibzada Khan,5.60,6.00,6.00,5.60,5.40,7.90,"this class is about building a learning environment together that honors the people in the space. it is about that process, and how each and every student feels and felt and will feel in that space, and how we can co–create space in response, in conversation with different authors and their writing."
,,,,,,,,,,,Mayed’s class is groundbreaking. A really great place to come alive and share with the class or withdraw into your quiet self.
,,,,,,,,,,,An incredible class with an incredible teacher. I never thought I’d get the chance to talk so honestly about the failures of our education system in a school classroom.
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a great class. We had great discussions and really built a community. I was exposed to topics that I was previously unfamiliar with. I would recommend this class because of how widely applicable the topics are for any field.
,,,,,,,,,,,Very insightful and engaging class. I highly recommend this course.
sesp,sesp,298,winter,Sahibzada Khan,5.83,5.83,5.83,5.50,6.00,5.00,mayed was great and this course taught a lot. i wish we had been able to somehow put what we talked about in action at NU though i don't know how that would have worked. i loved this class a lot and the community was amazing.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Best class I have ever taken at Northwestern ever and the best class I think I will ever take here. Really made me actually *think* about an unpack shit. mayed is amazing and the people in this course love amazing spectacular. If you really want to look into yourself and analyze (among other things) self–surveillance and self–policing, then this is the place to do it. It's a welcoming and open space that talks about those tougher conversations about abolition in an understandable way. I felt like I could be a part of the conversation. <3"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Mayed is so smart, wise, and articulate. I have learned so much from them and from my peers during my time in this course. Mayed was also super understanding, kind, and encouraging to us about taking care of ourselves above anything else. I can say I'm grateful to have been a part of this lovely learning environment and sharing space with Mayed and my peers this quarter. I 100% recommend this course to anyone that is interested in social justice, abolition, solidarity, community care, etc.!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Super interesting topic and lots of new ideas presented. It can be abstract at times but that’s to be expected. Professor Mayed does a good job of creating a conducive learning environment
sesp,sesp,299,winter,Paul Howard Arntson,5.00,5.00,4.43,4.57,4.57,4.14,Great course! You are partnered with a non–profit and complete a consulting project for them as a part of the civic engagement certificate program.
,,,,,,,,,,,I really appreciate how much input and freedom we have in choosing our community partner. I wanted to make sure it was a project I was both interested and passionate about. There is so much flexibility in choosing and really up to how much work you put in to creating those connections.
,,,,,,,,,,,Love my group and org I'm partnered with. Paul is very nice.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The way this class is run currently you are pretty much on your own. I don't have a problem with that, but I do think SESP has really dropped the ball on supporting both Prof. Arnston and the program in general. We always have to advocate for ourselves, and I wish the program was receiving more support because I think it could have been a lot better of an experience."
sesp,sesp,303,winter,Danny Cohen,4.20,4.00,3.47,3.40,4.20,3.86,"Danny is a great and very kind person, but very chaotic as a professor. The class was way better paced in the beginning than in the end. The class consisted of twice–a–week journal entries, almost weekly creative sparks (a short writing piece), and a final project. The final project also had miscellaneous parts to it due at different points of the quarter. Danny dropped on us an almost 6000–word group assignment two weeks before it was due, and there was also a final self–reflection that was literally due after the entire class concludes. No reading was technically mandatory, and there are ways to get around the miscellaneous writing assignments. This class really doesn’t incentivize you to learn or to design a good final social program (which was the goal of the class). For a person who majored, studied, and practiced design, I was a little surprised to see how disorganized our Canvas page was. Danny was also very ambitious in what he wanted to achieve, and the class discussion frequently went in unexpected directions that deviated us from the core material. Danny would also address minor points for way too long just to get one point across. Not the best class, and not the worst class. Very manageable work at the end of the day. A fitting cluster course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very easy class, but there were a lot of little assignments to do. Overall an easy sesp class to take"
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this class. Professor Cohen and Ms. Morrisroe bring excellent ideas to the in–class conversations and are both very thoughtful of the content and students.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Summary: easy class, interesting discussions, work piles on at end"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Assignments: 2 journal entries a week, 1 ""creative spark"" a week, team design project assignments every couple of weeks, with final presentation, final paper, and final reflection. This class was really interesting and I actually enjoyed doing all of the weekly readings and felt they related to the class content really well. Sometimes class discussions were unengaging and most of the class was usually zoned out, but the topics we discussed were interesting. We didn't learn a lot about actually designing social programs outside of the team design project and we didn't even start that project until like Week 8 besides choosing our program topic. The class didn't require much work but because we didn't focus on the design project until the end of the quarter, a lot of the work piled on in the last two weeks when it could have been spread out among earlier weeks. I wish we had done more hands–on activities to make class time more engaging––Danny can kind of just ramble for a long time during his lectures, but he has actual experience in the fields he teaches about which makes the class really interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,Easy A. Take this class if you are in SESP for a degree or extension requirement. Not much outside work and Professor Cohen is chill.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course allowed me to learn about very important topic related to social change. However, I wish this course was taught by someone other than a white man."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a major requirement and it was okay, if you have a different opinion than the teacher or projective students its really hard to speak or participate in class discussions. Very liberal class."
,,,,,,,,,,,easyyyyyy SESP class. take this if you want a stress free classroom environment
,,,,,,,,,,,Really enjoyed this course. Danny and Alexis are an awesome duo that clearly care about creating a class that teaches students. Classes are pretty discussion based and also a team project. Highly recommend.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is so easy. Definitely take it if you're looking for an easy A to fill one of your clusters. We had a 300 word journal entry due after each class, a creative spark (idea for a social solution) due once a week, and a final group project that's definitely manageable. I did other homework during the class because our in–class discussions were pretty odd. Sometimes they were meaningful, but most of the time, professor Cohen treated us like elementary schoolers. I'm not complaining, because I really enjoyed coloring, but I don't think the course necessarily did what it was advertising."
sesp,sesp,310,fall,Ofer Malamud,5.70,5.10,4.90,5.50,5.30,4.60,"Overall, this is a great SESP class to take if you are interested in regression and using STATA. The homework could be a bit lengthy and confusing at times, but the professor has a lenient grading policy and he encourages you to work in groups. The professor is also extremely kind and accommodating; he understands that the topics covered in class are difficult and he really tries his best to simplify concepts and offer a lot of real–life examples to help you understand."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is the best course I've taken and best professor I've had in my 4 years at NU. Prof Malamud is so kind and explains complex topics so well that they all make sense. A lot of the time with other professors, these concepts could be taught so much worse, but Prof Malamud is so great at teaching that I was looking forward to teaching his class. I think any student with criticism about his class would likely be the ones who barely showed up. He is also flexible with deadlines, understanding that students might need extra time. This is the only class I've looked forward to going to even at 9:30 in the morning. ALSO, the concepts he teaches are ones that I've had trouble with in the past, but what I think he does so well is explain the reasoning/logic behind it in conjunction with using applicable easy–to–understand examples. I feel confident in my understanding because of how well he taught the basics of each concept. I wish I could take more of his classes! I love him!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class. Teaches you a lot about statistics and its application in social sciences. Not math heavy at all – the professor made sure that everyone can understand the rationale behind the statistical methods but focuses more on the applying the theories into actual studies.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Love the professor, super nice and knowledgeable. God you got to love these SESP professors."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Ofer Malamud was very helpful he follows the 'if I offer something to one student I have to offer to all my students' mentality which can be helpful at times. He also asks for feedback often and tries to implement it which is nice. The class consists of problem sets that are weekly (more or less) and I think 4? 6? response papers we have to do but they're incredibly simple – one–page (MAX) double space. Would reccomend
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Malamud is great! Very approachable & understanding of students, and also a good lecturer imo whose easy to follow & uses comprehensive slides. He encourages people to work together for assignments, so it felt like a collaborative environment."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course has examples all throughout it & gives application practice through PSETS & the final which made it pretty interesting & practical for me. Problem sets are graded for effort (so usually 9/10 or 10/10 if answers are accurate). There's 4, 1–page response papers which are graded for completion (& he made 1 optional). The final assignment was coming up with a causal question and thinking through a quasi–experimental method for how we could evaluate it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"(If you've taken Econ 281, this is still a really interesting class with a lot more applications & more use of STATA.)"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely a bit challenging for a SESP stats course, but you learn a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,I wish there was more emphasis on real world policy
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a really great class for learning about how research papers are written, how data is gathered and analyzed. Great for those interested in policy research/analysis. I also plan to use this course as my elective for the Data Science minor, and would absolutely recommend it."
sesp,sesp,320,winter,Christopher Leatherwood,5.35,5.10,5.15,4.55,5.45,3.80,"This class was once a week, so there were many readings, but since you got a week, you had time to read. Discussion based class and Professor Leatherwood is an engaging professor so 3 hours passed by really quickly each time. Great teacher and great class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As long as you do your work and participate enough in class, you'll do great."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great course, different from other education courses. Totally discussion based and Professor Leatherwood does a great job facilitating the conversation"
,,,,,,,,,,,It was amazing! TAKE THIS. I think it should be required for all SESP students
,,,,,,,,,,,Awesome course. All discussion based so if you are quiet might be hard but I don't think he penalyzes you for not talking. You will actually want to listen and engage. I have never been in a class that fostered such interesting conversations. Professor Leatherwood has amazing prompts and readings that really make you think. The assignments are all very relaxed but that is the point. The goal is to focus on learning rather than assignments which is nice.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Discussion based course, might be important to keep in mind for those who are used to purely lecture based courses. Not much HW and the final was interesting. 3 hour classes do drag on, though."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was very interested in this class going in but was surprised to discover that this class was very white with very few students of color. I think this inherently impacts the quality of the discussions occurring in the class because you have to expect these conversations to be dominated by white voices. The discussions themselves lacked the depth I was hoping for and were very much surface–level, which was disappointing given that the contents of the readings could have produced generative and productive discussions. I also don't think this class being three hours helped this situation because it was very easy to become disengaged with the discussions. These discussions were being led by a different group of students each week, and I think providing students with some structure as to how the discussion should be led based on readings would have helped push the conversations beyond the surface–level. as a person of color, I unfortunately did not gain as much as I wanted to out of this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"You must take this class if you are at all interested in our racialized education system. But more importantly, you must take a class with Professor Leatherwood who I truly believe is one of the best professors at Northwestern. If you like class discussions and diving into challenging topics, this is the class for you. Homework load is not too heavy, but instead engagement in class is encouraged. Take it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, this was a very good course. It was entirely discussion–based, readings were interesting and relevant, and the work wasn't difficult. The nearly 3 hour aspect wasn't fantastic and Professor Leatherwood wasn't always the most organized or the most clear communicator, but I didn't think that got in the way of my learning."
,,,,,,,,,,,I love having classes with Professor Leatherwood. He is the best. Take this class even if you are not interested in the topic.
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Leatherwood is amazing! There are weekly readings that you discuss in class and a final project on a topic of your choice (rarely did you have to submit anything – just had to show up and participate). Really enjoyed the course content.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was a low workload, and there were some interesting readings. However this class is discussion based which is not everyone's cup of tea."
,,,,,,,,,,,TAKE THIS CLASS!! It is such a great class I learned a lot.
,,,,,,,,,,,"A really great discussion–based class! Nearly three hours at night can be a lot, but the time often flies and the discussions we have are very interesting! Loved how collaborative and project–based the course was and Prof. Leatherwood is great!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Take this with prof leatherwood! He is so amazing and this class was great!
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class with Professor Leatherwood! Very non–traditional format—highly discussion–based, less written assignments, lots of peer–to–peer engagement. If that sounds like something you would like, take this class! If that sounds like a lack of structure that would stress you out, don't take it."
sesp,sesp,323,spring,Danny Cohen,5.58,5.43,5.52,5.38,5.58,4.52,The professors were very insightful about the course concepts
,,,,,,,,,,,chill class
,,,,,,,,,,,THIS IS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT NORTHWESTERN. IF YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE IT YOU MUST.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Amazing course, I learned a lot and was really challenged intellectually as well. This was one of the only lecture–based classes that I've taken which I'm interested the entire time. Danny and Alexis are amazing professors and I would take any classes they taught."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is amazing! If you have the opportunity, please take it. Danny is amazing and has so much passion and anecdotal knowledge to offer. I loved going to class and I really enjoyed the readings. Although the content was really heavy, he ensured that all students were doing okay. He also allowed space for participation in different formats, like partners, groups, class discussions, discussion posts, etc. He made sure all students' voices were heard throughout the entire course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is one of the greatest classes I have taken at Northwestern. Danny and Alexis are kind, amazing human beings, and I came to class excited to listen to them. The course is emotionally taxing, though. While I think everyone should take this class, you need to be prepared to be emotionally overwhelmed at times. I also think you should only take this class if you are going to fully apply yourself and engage with the materials, but that is my personal view."
,,,,,,,,,,,One of my favorite classes that I have taken so far at NU. I cannot recommend this course enough.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I definitely recommend this class –– Danny and Alexis are super kind, I genuinely learned so much, and the workload is not bad. With that being said, I wasn't a big fan of how classes were structured sometimes. Often it felt like just a few people talking back and forth with Danny. I honestly felt uncomfortable speaking up in a class a lot because I felt like I would be judged by some of the people in the class. Still, it was a good class and I'm glad I took it."
,,,,,,,,,,,ONE OF THE MOST INSIGHTFUL AND ENGAGING CLASSES AT NU
,,,,,,,,,,,"I know a lot of people loved this course, but it was definitely not my favorite. Our in–class discussions often went on tangents, and Professor Cohen hardly ever refocused the class. The whole course was whole–group discussion, which often meant that a few voices dominated the dialogue. There was no chance for a student who preferred small group dialogue to contribute to the discourse. The course assigns almost no work, so I can't complain, but I just wish I had the opportunity to learn more."
sesp,sesp,325,spring,Christopher Leatherwood,5.56,5.32,5.05,4.89,5.61,3.21,I think it was a good class. Pretty chill and not too much work. Sometimes it'd be uncomfortable because the topics we're discussing are challenging but that's the point. Professor Leatherwood's teaching style can be pretty unique. I would probably recommend but Prof Leatherwood is leaving after this quarter so I don't know if the course will stay.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is not for the faint of heart: if you take it, you need to be ready to learn and to participate, and to be critical of many often–controversial topics such as racism in schools, policing, and discipline policies. To get the most out of this course, participate as much as possible and lean into the discomfort. You WILL get a lot out of it if you do!"
,,,,,,,,,,,great discussion based class and it allowed me to think deeply about my educational experiences.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Super easy class. You won't learn much beyond what you already know, but it is still very interesting. The readings are worth your time: you will not really be held accountable for completing them, but they are engaging and eye–opening. The lectures were somewhat repetitive, but fascinating. Take this class for the expectation of open, honest discussion: don't take it if you want to gain concrete skills."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you're a white and wealthy student, you probably will really enjoy this class and learn a lot. If you're a FGLI student of color who holds life experiences with school discipline and race in educational settings, it may be difficult to sit through. I was the latter, and honestly, this class was, at many times, an uncomfortable experience. It's pretty open discussion based, which allows for a lot of pushback and conversation. The good thing is: Professor Leatherwood and Sarah were very open to critiques, and we had discussions about being in courses centered around race as a POC when the room is very white. They also do a good job of holding students who may be ignorant of their privileges accountable and questioning them. Overall, I'd highly highly recommend taking this class if you've experienced more privilege than marginalization in life, as you will be deeply challenged and changed. If you have various intersecting identities, you will still learn, but I'd think about how comfortable you'd be with open conversations on experiences you may have encountered before taking the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,I think this class is amazing. Understanding discipline from a different lens is crucial in understanding the racialized system of education. Professor Leatherwood never ceases to amaze me.
,,,,,,,,,,,It went well and it was cool listening from other students experiences.
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class. Discussions were great and I genuinely learned so much.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really interesting course material and an incredibly insightful professor. A little challenging when it comes to social policy implementing and coming up with new policies in a realistic way (that pleases teachers, students, parents, and administrators), but an important challenge. Really interesting readings!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a really great class. Professor Leatherwood does not stress grades, which really allows you to learn for the sake of caring about the material and the applications to social justice in our real lives. The way he structures class is great too as it was mostly class discussions which were interesting and mainly led by students. You could tell he genuinely cared about what he taught and really cared about each student and their own contributions. Really sad that he's leaving as he is a great Professor and an even better person."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Chris and Sarah are incredible educators, and this is an incredible class. If you're a student of color (especially Black), there will be some readings/topics where you feel like you're not learning anything particularly new, just because you've lived through whatever the reading is talking about. However, the way the class is run really makes you put the concepts into practice in real time in a way that's really cool, and it's going to affect the way I see the rest oof my education here. I'm not sure what it will look like without Chris leading the room, but it's been one of my favorite classes at NU so far."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was such an amazing course, I hope it is taught again!"
sesp,sesp,351,fall,Danny Cohen,5.77,5.50,5.50,5.23,5.73,4.89,Great class. Great professors. It is clear they both have a passion for the material and it really makes you want to learn and dive deep in the material. Daily journal entries were a bit tedious but the interesting classes made up for it
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class! Danny and Alexis are amazing! This course really helped me to understand how movies, comics, and books serve as vehicles for public learning."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As long as you stay on top of the biweekly journal reflections (that Danny and Alexis enoucrage you to complete during class) and weekly open projects, you will do well in this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Danny is very passionate about the class and he cares a lot about whether students learn. He doesn't believe in grades, so as long as you're completing assignments with thought and effort you'll do fine. I enjoyed the books/movies, but it did get tedious having to do a creative response every week"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Loved this course. Would highly recommend – Danny and Alexis are awesome! I took this class because I wanted to learn more about Holocaust history and this course exceeded my expectations. You also do not need to be super knowledgeable on the topic before coming into the class. It is structured by each week there is a different film or text to watch / read and a partner creative response due as well as ""journal entries"" reflecting on class discussion."
,,,,,,,,,,,Had a love–hate relationship with this course. The assignments are sooo tedious and have very minimal value which almost takes away from the content
,,,,,,,,,,,"Loved this class, Professors Danny and Alexis are great professors and care more for your learning than simply handing out a grade. They help break down a tough topic in thought–provoking ways."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Classwork is made up of a mixture of films, readings, solo/group projects, and class discussions. You definitely get what you put into this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was an awesome, interesting, low–stress Holocaust film analysis course. I got to watch a movie each week for school which was awesome and the assignments were so low time commitment. Danny and Alexis are wonderful! Definitely take this class if you have any interest."
,,,,,,,,,,,"i loved this class. danny and alexis are both amazing. there is a good amount of work because you need to watch a movie and make a project on it each week, but you get used to managing the assignments. i learned so much and am so happy i took this class. the only reason i wouldn't recommend is if you have a hard time with graphic movies and books and stuff about genocide."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I absolutely loved this course. Danny and Alexis are incredible teachers who are so educated on this topic, and I can't recommend this class enough. I learned so much from this course, and Danny and Alexis made sure to make it clear that they wanted us to learn for the sake of learning and not be worried about grades. We watched movies on the Holocaust each week and then wrote creative responses, applying our knowledge on the film and creating something we wanted with a partner. The final project was also very fun to do, watching movies we hadn't watched in class and making our own creative project."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is thought provoking and helps change your mind about Holocaust interpretations in film. Watching a movie for hw is always a positive and doesn't use too many conventional teaching methods. Only problem is one of the professors does zoom so you have to sit on class in zoom. To me that ruined going to class everyday. why do we still have to do that...
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great course and love Danny and Alexis! They make a class with difficult content really approachable and interesting to learn about. Minimal work (2x week journal entries, scattered readings, weekly creative responses) but will say the assigned movies can be long sometimes (>3 hrs). Overall highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"One of the best courses I've taken. Danny and Alexis are awesome and are an example of excellent teaching that clearly tries to take into account their knowledge about learning science. If you take this class, try to show and up participate for them they care so much and seem to really enjoy talking and being in the classroom."
,,,,,,,,,,,Such an amazing class! Would highly recommend taking this course as it is not an overly big workload and the films and short stories and discussions are engaging to learn about Holocaust history and education through. Danny and Alexis do such a great job with allowing you to engage in many different ways and to reflect on what can be troubling and difficult conversations and narratives around Holocaust history. Would say this is a must take class and one that you'd be lucky enough to take as it covers such important info and allows you to take educational and historical program insights with you to future classes.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is good, a lot of movie watching which isn't as easy as it seems. Alexis the TA isn't always really receptive to the creative responses but overall the class is a good chance to delve into the holocaust and modern antisemitism"
,,,,,,,,,,,This has been one of my favorite courses at Northwestern so far. Danny and Alexis are great instructors and really passionate about what they are teaching. This course gives a much deeper depiction of the truths behind the Holocaust and many more perspectives than one might be exposed to outside of this class. Assignments consisted of journal entries to reflect after each class and creative responses to films or books every week. One bigger creative response as a final assignment with a bigger group.
sesp,sesp,372,fall,Christopher Leatherwood,5.53,4.27,4.33,4.27,5.27,5.41,Take this class with Professor Leatherwood! It's low stress. Assignments and the final paper involve your group studying a space on campus. Field note observations and interview transcription assignments can be tedious but not difficult. Prof was also receptive to our feedback and eliminated the weekly discussion posts halfway through the quarter.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Course takes up a lot of time outside of class, but professor is very accommodating."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I love Professor Netherwood, but this course is a lot of busy work. Do not take it if it is not a major or minor requirement."
,,,,,,,,,,,I thought the course was not helpful for any of my objectives
,,,,,,,,,,,"DR LEATHERWOOD IS THE BEST. TAKE THIS COURSE/ANY COURSE W HIM. Especially methods, he is very passionate and caring, and truly lectures like no other at NU"
,,,,,,,,,,,CHRIS IS THE GREATEST PROFESSOR EVER. He is clearly so passionate about the topic of research and LOVES teaching. I had no interest in the subject and he got me excited about it. He cares so much about the student experience and takes our feedback very seriously. You HAVE to take this class with Chris.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Leatherwood is great; the discussions are great and he is so receptive to student feedback. He asks us what we're thinking and really takes it into consideration. He also likes to question us when we assert things, and at first it's a little strange, but I think it's refreshing! I really enjoy him as a professor, and encourage students to take the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class looked daunting, especially with a group project that was completed throughout the whole quarter. However, this course was fun and lighthearted. Professor Leatherwood is extremely accommodating."
,,,,,,,,,,,It’s a requirement. Prof Leatherwood is super cool and very nice. I’d say with this class take it with a professor that you like since that will make the difference
,,,,,,,,,,,"It is clear that Professor Leatherwood is incredibly passionate about the subject in the class, which enhances the learning experience in the class. He is also clearly interested in including student input in how the class is organized."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really liked how there were a lot of team/group projects
,,,,,,,,,,,"I mean this class is a SESP requirement so there's not much to say. I'm personally not super interested in ethnographic field work, so this class felt a bit like a chore at times. I still don't understand why this course is required, and it felt super disconnected from all of my other SESP content."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Leatherwood is pretty good.
,,,,,,,,,,,"given that you have to take this course as a sesp requirement, there is not much you can do. but I really, really hated this course and it was one of the worst I've taken in all of college. Chris is super understanding and cool, but there was just wayyyy too much work. if you aren't interested in the subject (which I wasn't), I would suggest finding an easier professor who gives less work."
sesp,sesp,372,fall,Amanda Peel,5.06,5.06,4.56,4.06,4.78,5.17,"This class is pretty easy. It is a group research project that adds onto itself week by week. There isn't a lot of structure, so it is important for your group to be people who want to take initiative in what they are doing. As long as you finish the assignments with a decent attention to detail and show your willingness to learning, you should be able to get a good grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a little broad, we had too much room to come up with research that it became difficult to know what we were supposed to be doing. The class itself was a little dull, although the material isn't inherently boring. Some of the homework feels like busywork but the class is easy to do well in."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was simple enough as prior CTEC's mentioned but it was also so full of information, I really felt that I learned something every class and that I was practicing what I was learning every class."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really liked the ungraded structure of this class because it took a lot of the pressure off. Dr. Peel is really kind and a good teacher. The readings were also super reasonable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Field Research Methods is one of those kinds of core classes that you just have to get over, but if you're able to take it with Professor Peel, I highly recommend it! She uses materials that are very easily digestible (we had a graphic novel as our main reading), and if the concepts got too abstract or difficult to understand at times, she was always extremely nice and approachable/willing to answer any questions we had. The observations (4 hours across the quarter) were also pretty interesting and fun to do, and I enjoyed the ability to work with people that I wanted to in a group – the class would have been unenjoyable otherwise. The class was also ungraded, which really allowed us to learn for the sake of learning, if anything, and it made it very stress–free."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The professor is super nice. I loved the ungraded system, I thought it really helped me focus on learning rather than grades."
,,,,,,,,,,,"After taking this class, expect to have a solid understanding of the foundations of qualitative research theory and methods. Prof. Peel did a great job in structuring the curriculum lectures and providing assignments that allowed us to practice what we learned. The material may sometimes feel boring, but it's still important to learn about the qualitative side of research as opposed to just the quantitative."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was really fun!
,,,,,,,,,,,Amazing course that helps you think outside the standard quantitative methods of research. Highly recommend!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Decent course. Not too taxing in terms of course load. Do the work, and you'll be fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was more challenging than I expected it to be. I feel as if some assignments were unnecessarily long. I also feel like instructions were often unclear on assignments. For example, we had a final presentation that we did as a group and then we had a writeup that was individual although we developed our grounded theory as a group."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was pretty boring but not hard at all. I took it because it's required for people in SESP. It's ungraded so there's less stress on that end, but you still need to submit good work. As long as you keep up with assignments and attend class (attendance was tracked and part of grade) you'll be fine. Assignments are mostly weekly journals and group work. Prof. Peel and Shai were as helpful as they could be but some of the info was just very new to us so it took my group a little while to figure out what we were doing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor and TA both super nice and understanding with extensions and the learning process with a course that is so different from all other courses. Lecture could be a bit boring at times, but there was also a lot of time to work and think in class rather than out of class which was nice. Wish there was a little bit more help in terms of grouping people together (ended up with just 1 partner while other groups had 5, and a more even split could have been useful). Also wish there was a peer evaluation at the end."
sesp,sesp,372,winter,Lilah Shapiro,5.67,5.06,5.06,4.83,5.56,5.67,This class is an interesting introduction to observational research and research through interviews. I appreciated the readings that we did and found the discussions about the readings to be interesting. I enjoyed the final interview project. Occasionally the pace of the class was slow but I would recommend it as a whole.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was ok but very often it just felt like rich white folks speaking on behalf of marginalized people and thinking that they are soooo different from other rich white people. Instead of highlighting that bad research is everywhere and you could be unintentionally doing it, I felt that our class was structured to think that we are the ""good"" ones and we would never conduct ""bad"" research. There were certainly opportunities for self–criticism but only reviewing your own work can yield a limited amount of fruit. Our class discussions were not really interesting or productive, but mostly because of SESP in general and not the class itself. It irked me that my classmates were so afraid of defending readings that Prof Shapiro would preface as ""bad"" research. The culture within SESP to always agree with each other stultifies our critical thinking skills. I would love to see people respectfully disagree or grapple with each other’s ideas more freely. But I'm also contributing to this culture so who am I to criticize... In the future I hope that Prof Shapiro does not insert her opinion on the readings before we read them. This might prevent students from not having preconceived notions and intentionally seeking out elements in the reading. I would also appreciate it if she created more space for students to just…. think on their own. Wait time / thinking time is not a bad thing!! Discussions about the readings sometimes did not feel like discussions. It was 40% students talking and 60% Prof. Shapiro talking. Melanie the TA was great."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is a lot of work but the work is all very relevant and helpful. If you are going to do research at all in the future or read any kind of research (which everyone does) this class is very helpful. Lilah is amazing as always and the best professor at NU. Take this class or any class with her because she is the best.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a SESP requirement, so I would recommend taking it with Shapiro. She is so kind and genuinely cares about her students. She took the time to go through all of the materials carefully. This class does have a good amount of work, but it is not difficult. She made sure to give us time in class to complete much of our work. All of the readings we had were truly interesting and I enjoyed discussing them in the class. At the end of the quarter, you end up grading yourself."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Lilah is such a wonderful human being. Methods with her is significantly more work than with other professors (I believe). I intentionally took it with her because she is very meticulous with her teaching and has a curricular emphasis on interviewing. For someone who wants to go into research or do a thesis project, taking methods with Lilah is definitely a very good choice. She is super super understanding. The class was all out of completion grades with self–grading/self–assessment. The assignments included 3 field observations + field notes, and one final interview project that encompassed 2 interviews and open–coding for those interviews. If you wish to learn field methods, take it with Lilah – she is amazing at what she does and a great thinker! If you just want to cruise by and get the credit, maybe with somebody else."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely recommend taking this class with Lilah! She's an amazing professor and our class discussions were always really engaging. Our TA Melanie was also the best and so nice. Grades were mostly for completion and with an emphasis on growth, so as long as you do your best and integrate any feedback they give you, you'll be fine. There is a lot of writing for this class, but it's not too hard as long as you take your time with it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"the course was super interesting and fun. it was a little time consuming sometimes, but fine if you start your work early and don't fall behind. lilah is also a great instructor and super sweet"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty easy and manageable class. You work in groups the whole time and submit a final project at the end (final presentation). You do 2 observations, 2 interviews and 1 final presentation."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great course! Lots of work tho
,,,,,,,,,,,"this course definitely introduced me to topics in field research in depth. i think that the final project was also effective in applying lessons from the course to real life in a very thoughtful and stimulating manner. while i did enjoy the course overall, i do think there were very lengthy readings that sometimes just repeated what previous readings had said"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course it really great! Professor Shapiro is really passionate about helping us learn and practice the use of ethnography and interviewing. I especially found her feedback on our work really helpful, and as long as you put the work into this class you can do very well!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was a really great way to delve into the realm of qualitative research and analysis. Taking it with Professor Shapiro was awesome!
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed reading various ethnographies, and class discussions"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm glad this class is a SESP requirement because I definitely learned a lot. I loved SESP 200 with Lilah, and she did not disappoint with SESP 272. The class definitely had a lot of work, although I wouldn't call it busy work. All of the assignments felt very meaningful and had an overarching purpose for the learning objectives. We had a few readings throughout the quarter that were pretty long, but some of them were super interesting and they read like a novel rather than an academic paper. The class was ungraded, which allowed for flexibility and definitely eased stress. I heard that other professors assigned less work, so take that as you will. I definitely recommend taking the class with Lilah, though. And Melanie, our TA, was also amazing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Field methods is a requirement for SESP, would not recommend taking it if you do not absolutely need to. The workload is on and off. I really like Lilah (Prof. Shapiro), but the topics of this class were not super engaging. The beginning of the quarter is lighter with a few readings and then the end of the quarter really piles up and there are generally multiple time–consuming assignments due for any given week."
sesp,sesp,372,winter,Briellen Griffin,5.79,5.47,5.40,5.14,5.64,3.53,"Loved this class and professor Griffin. This class should be mandatory for everyone, finally helped to fill the gaps on writing research papers or conducting any type of research. A new found appreciation and understanding. Well done professor!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Nice Professor, grading is fair and low time commitment for the most part"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Griffin is the BEST! It's hard to make a research methods class interesting, but she does a great job of engaging students and helping us learn. I recommend taking this class with Dr. Griffin if you have to take it for SESP req."
,,,,,,,,,,,"if you can, take this class with Prof Griffin, she is the best!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Griffin is awesome. She truly wants you to learn and makes research interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Amazing class, even more amazing professor. Work actually makes sense and can be applicable in real life. Dr. Griffin truly cares about your well–being and that you learn something in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Griffin is the best. She made this class so engaging. Going into it, I thought it would be a repeat of what I've learned in other classes, but it was not. We learned about new approaches to research and I learned to look at research in a whole new way. Throughout the quarter you focus on a research topic of your choice, so it makes the actual assignments interesting because it's a topic you choose."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Griffin is awesome
sesp,sesp,372,spring,Regina Logan,5.75,5.25,5.40,4.95,5.58,4.60,"This was a great course. It was not difficult or time–consuming at all but I still learned so much. I really, really would recommend you take this freshman or sophomore year, as this course has truly shown me the different types of research and how you can research basically anything you are interested in or have a passion for in a way that is not just graphs and numbers."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is an “ungraded” course which took a lot of the stress off. The work we did was interesting, with a group research project at the end. Professor Logan is very kind and enthusiastic."
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this class! Gina is amazing and I learned so much!
,,,,,,,,,,,"AMAZING CLASS!!!! You will do exactly what is promised: you will learn how to complete an ethnography. Through concrete application of course concepts to your own chosen research site, you will figure ethnography out through hands–on practice. Super fun class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Amazing class and amazing professor.
,,,,,,,,,,,SUPER chill class but also relevant and fun
,,,,,,,,,,,great class but make sure to pace yourself in terms of finishing assignments. the professor does self–grading so it's best to put your best foot forward.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Logan taught this course so well. I loved being able to take this course and learn how to properly observe like a researcher. The readings were essential in the success of this class, and I really liked how the course was designed to help you succeed for the final project."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class. I really dislike research, but the content is not as heavy as one may assume. Professor Logan and our fantastic TA Fortunate were great assets to this class. This class is ungraded so a lot more accountability falls on you and your group. Take this class if you are at all interested in research, it really gives you many alternate options and perspectives."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall good course, kinda what you put in you will get out. The ungraded aspect made it easy to actually enjoy the process of learning, and none of the assignments were too strenous. Getting field notes done can be a bit challenging, but she is aware of this and doesn't make you do too many and gives you helpful and positive feedback."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great course
,,,,,,,,,,,The course went well. I thought it was interesting observing and taking field notes.
sesp,sesp,372,spring,Amanda Peel,4.90,4.18,4.09,3.77,4.35,4.82,Professor Peel is awesome! you can tell she has a longstanding passion for field methods and that's what makes her teaching so great. Her knowledge on everything makes her feedback on assignments so precise and helpful. She is also very encouraging as a person which makes me feel good about the class and my performance. Love!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class, not a lot of work, and interesting subject!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this class! The workload is quite light (a big chunk of each class is dedicated to teamwork), and all the work throughout the quarter builds towards the final project. Prof Peel is very kind and down–to–earth, but sometimes her lectures can be a bit repetitive of the reading. Overall, you will learn the basics of field research methods. Pick a good team!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Chill class, not hard if you put in some work. It's a heavily group–based class, so just make sure you get a GOOD GROUP."
,,,,,,,,,,,Try to stay on track and you'll be good.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I struggled to stay engaged in this class, and I felt like there are ways to make the instruction periods more engaging for the students. I didn't think the assignments outside of class were too challenging as long as you do the readings, but the readings could be long and dense at times and were not always explained fully in class. I was also overwhelmed by how much there was to do in the last two weeks in the quarter, and it's really important that you choose a good, focused group to make sure you stay on track."
,,,,,,,,,,,"For a required SESP course, this course was a good one. Creating my ethnography with a group of my choosing was honestly pretty fun, and the course's ""ungraded"" method took the pressure off individual assignments so I had the opportunity to focus on my learning. This course doesn't have much work, you really don't need to do the readings, and you'll even learn a thing or two."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Class was kind of slow and unengaging at times. Class lectures would just summarize the readings––very well, but it made reading in advance seem pointless since it was alll recapped. Dr. Peele seems very kind and chill though! There wasn't much to do in the class until the last 3 weeks. In comparison, I heard the other section with a different instructor brought in guest speakers and made the pace of class more upbeat. Dr. Peele was very accomodating and the ungraded format makes it less stressful throughout."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course felt like a pretty standard class. It wasn't bad but it wasn't super engaging either. I liked the ungraded nature because I could focus on learning about research instead of worrying about my grade.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I came to this class thinking that it might be boring, but the professor really tried to make the course engaging. I really love the textbook and my project team!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"For me, this class got boring and uninteresting really fast. It is a required course, so I just championed through it, but it was difficult as the material for my group project was very dull. However, to bypass this: make sure you pick a very interesting topic you're passionate about for your project and get together a good group. Your experience in this class is what you make of it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"this class was a lot of work and was pretty annoying. you have to do all your work in a group and if other members don't contribute, you have a lot more to do. i would take another research methods class if possible."
sesp,sesp,391,spring,Lilah Shapiro,5.70,5.60,5.40,5.50,5.60,7.40,"I loved this class so much. Even if you're on the fence about writing a thesis, the class alone is so valuable for learning about the research process. The structure is so well set up to help you write a fully fleshed out thesis proposal without making it feel like an overwhelming amount of work. You get plenty of time and support to write each portion, and the feedback is thorough and clearly caringly thought through. Lilah is a phenomenal first ""advisor"" and makes the class fun and engaging. She makes it clear how invested she is in your success. Andrew is one of my favorite TAs I've ever had. Fabulous class!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, it was a really great class and Lilah and Andrew have been some of my favorite professors/TAs at Northwestern, they were really helpful and kind! The class was very chill and we got a lot of working time. The class did vary a lot in the time required for assignments from an hour a week to over ten a week."
,,,,,,,,,,,"good at framing the thesis, very laid back (though it was hard to stay motivated then)"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really loved this course. Lilah was extremely helpful and so was our TA, Andrew. If you are planning on writing a thesis, please take this course with Lilah. Researching for the first time is very difficult and scary, but Lilah was with all of us every step of the way and made sure we felt like we were in a good place. She was honest, realistic, compassionate, and engaging. She made sure we took care of ourselves mentally throughout the quarter while also pushing us to do the best that we could. I really loved this course. Before starting it, I wasn't sure if I was going to go through with the thesis. However, after taking the course and writing the proposal, I have so much passion for my topic and research because of Lilah and our cohort."
,,,,,,,,,,,Super helpful in forming the research proposal!!!!
,,,,,,,,,,,Lilah and Andrew are so amazing and helped me through this project. I learned a ton about my research topic but also how to perform research itself and be curious about every field that was related.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class can definitely be a little intimidating, as is the entire senior thesis project, but seriously Lilah makes the process so approachable. We broke down the draft for the proposal into manageable sections and Lilah and our TA Andrew were really so supportive and understanding. They were always there to help with any questions and available to meet at any time we needed to touch base. Couldn't have gotten through it without them!"
sesp,sesp,392,fall,Briellen Griffin,6.00,5.17,5.00,4.00,6.00,5.84,"Overall, SESP needs to rethink their practicum program. Many of the internships they offer are low–paid or unpaid, and the work is menial and teaches the students nothing. Do not expect SESP or your advisor to help you in any way during the internship hunt if you are looking for a paid opportunity or something related to your major. I am very grateful to have found a great internship for my practicum, but I know some students are not as lucky. SESP needs to do more to support students during the internship hunt, as well as provide stipends and grants to support students as they pay full tuition to do unpaid work unrelated to their major. That being said, Dr. Griffin was amazing and I'm glad I got to take this course with her. The workload was very light and she was very supportive. I enjoyed my practicum experience because of the internship I found and Dr. Griffin, but I hope SESP can do more to support practicum students going forwards."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Griffin is great, and I appreciated at least having some discussion with other students during what is essentially a quarter off. About halfway through the quarter, people kind of just stopped coming to class, which made it feel less engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Griffin is the best!! Although I wish this course had been in person, Dr. Griffin made it the best it could be. I enjoyed the opportunity to reflect on my Practicum and hear about others' experiences."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Griffin was very helpful and wanted to give us the experience we were looking for. She was available if we ever needed help, and she kept the seminars short, sweet, and to the point and let the practicum be our main focus."
sesp,sesp,392,winter,Cheryl Judice,5.44,5.18,4.18,3.82,5.20,3.00,"In my opinion, the seminar for practicum is extremely unnecessary. When students are working 30–40 hours a week compared to the usual 15ish hours in a classroom, there is no time for extra assignments and classes. That being said, YOU MUST TAKE THIS SEMINAR WITH PROFESSOR JUDICE. She's super understanding of the practicum's drain on students and is very lenient with deadlines. Class doesn't go past an hour even though it is 3 hours long. There is a minimal number of assignments. It's very chill."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I feel like the class was a waste of time. I think it's stupid to not have a canvas page. If you are an instructor, it should be required that you have a canvas page."
,,,,,,,,,,,The learning objectives were scattered and not well–organized.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Class discussions were boring and pointless. Nobody really cared about them, and it was just a check–in. There wasn't a point in meeting in–person (or on zoom) for the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was great! The professor is so kind and invested in our practicum experiences which I really appreciate. She gave feedback and advice when we were facing challenges and her class helped me think more broadly about my organization and work. It was also fun to hear about other people's experiences and sites.
,,,,,,,,,,,"your practicum experience will 99% depend on your site, but this class was fine. It felt a little pointless at time but the professor is chill about deadlines and lets us out early most of the time"
,,,,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed this class!
,,,,,,,,,,,Take this class with Professor Judice. Best section by far.
,,,,,,,,,,,Amazing course! Dr judice is the best. She is respectful and a great mentor. Also she keeps class to an hour
sesp,sesp,392,winter,Doris Jean Blesoff,5.57,4.57,4.43,4.43,5.14,3.57,"Great course, got to know a lot about the topics discussed and my classmates as well. Professor Blesoff is fantastic and very understanding and willing to work with students on any issues or questions."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was unnecessarily a lot of work. There were discussion posts and discussion journals every week on top of preparation and readings for the three hour class. I worked full–time and also commuted downtown so finding the time to do all the work was extremely difficult. The professor also is not understanding of this and takes off a lot of points for late work. One of the least understanding SESP professors I've ever had. The point of practicum is to prioritize our work experience so it was pretty frustrating to be penalized for doing exactly that. If you can, definitely take the class in person and enjoy life."
,,,,,,,,,,,Very helpful professor
sesp,sesp,392,spring,Ritu Tripathi,5.58,5.17,4.83,4.08,5.55,3.36,It was nice to hear from other students about their own work experience in their respective industries
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course was manageable, and the professor made the class engaging. The main focus was the work we did at our practicum, and the class was a space for reflection and gathering more knowledge about potential career interests."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Rithu is legit the best, she's so sweet and caring and actually has an interest in our practicum. Love her."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great course, Dr. Tripathi is incredibly kind and understanding as well as qualified! Not too much outside of class work that is unnecessary."
sesp,sesp,392,spring,Jeannette Colyvas,4.50,3.60,3.90,3.60,4.30,6.40,I felt like the classes were very long. I definitely don't think the seminar needed to be a full three hours.
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was so hard to sit through. Professor Colyvas admitted that she knew we were miserable almost every class. It was so lecture heavy and it was hard to go to after working the whole day.
,,,,,,,,,,,I didn't feel like the course was applicable to my internship and I would have preferred to have a course more specific to the social policy concentration.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Hardest part was getting through it on a Monday night, assignments could be a little time consuming, but they did help me think about my work and org more deeply. Final paper was nice as it was a partner paper. Prof Colyvas was also great and super dedicated and knowledgeable about the content."
,,,,,,,,,,,"You have to take this class so there's not much say. If you're not LOC this class is going to be so boring and irrelevant that it's painful to sit through. I really hope that SESP changes the curriculum or format of this course so that it can actually be educational or separated by major because honestly as a social policy major, I don't feel the need to be talking to someone working at a private equity firm as their practicum. There is minimal work outside of class so that's fine, but the class itself is often hard to get through"
wnbg,psych,101,spring,Alissa Chung,5.38,5.00,5.00,4.75,5.13,5.00,"I really enjoyed this seminar as the discussions we had each class was very closely related to personal experiences, making it easier to engage. There was quite a bit of work to do throughout the quarter (readings + discussion posts before each class, 2 essays, and leading/facilitating a discussion), but definitely manageable. Professor Chung was also very good at providing additional resources/insight from the psychology field about what we were discussing, which made the conversations a lot more interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,Very good course taught by and amazing professor. Tough grading but your writing improves significantly and you learn as much as you want to bring to the discussion table.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is not a substitute for an intro to psych class but rather deals with the family and upbringing side of developmental psychology. While an interesting lens, this class does deal with some harsh topics, as well as ideas that are but theories right now. The seminar fashion allows these ideas to flourish."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course made me more aware of how vital experiences in infancy and childhood are to an individual's adult life.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Chung is THE BEST. I loved taking the seminar with her and expand my passion on Psych. Moreover, Professor Chung ALWAYS replied promptly to my emails and let me attending office hours in extra–oficial time"
wnbg,psych,101,winter,Sara Broaders,4.40,4.30,4.90,4.70,4.90,5.60,"I loved this class! It was definitely a lot of reading, but all the topics were so interesting that I didn't mind. All of the in class activities, documentaries and discussions were also super interesting and engaging. It challenged me to reevaluate how I define a weird belief and analyze the validity of some of my own beliefs. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking for an interesting seminar, but I would not recommend taking it with other reading heavy courses."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed the pace of this course, however I do feel at times that the grading was a little tough compared to the amount of time and energy put into each assignment."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course. The content was extremely interesting and classes were engaging and consisted of many fun activities and interesting discussions. That being said, this course is extremely demanding. Not only are the reading assignments extremely long, but assignments are also graded super harshly. However, I will say the readings being long was not too bad because they were super interesting and I enjoyed them. I sometimes feel as though I was writing worse because I was so stressed about the grading. Not impossible to do well in the class and I think it was definitely worth it, but just a little frustrating that seminars can be this intense and vary this much from one another since they are required for all WCAS students and all count the same."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There are two discussion posts a week, one short paper (3 pages), one long paper (8–10 pages), and a lot of required readings. Her grading is incredibly harsh and in my opinion, quite unfair. She returns discussion posts graded on paper too late to be able to know what comments and things to fix in the next discussion post. The topics were not as exciting as I thought it would be. There were only a few classes that I enjoyed going to out of all the classes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Broaders is great. This class is really interesting and I was engaged in topics that I hadn't heard of and could appreciate where believers were coming from in most cases. I really enjoyed this course, just do the readings and contribute to discussion."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Do not take this class! It is far too challenging for a freshman year writing seminar, I know people genuinely unsure of if they will pass the class. I do not feel like my writing has improved at all during this course and it had the most work out of all of my classes. Discussion posts 1–2 times per week were graded very harshly and had about 200 pages of reading required to complete them. The readings were very interesting but I felt disappointed by the discussion as I was never able to talk about the parts that I found most interesting due to the way it was moderated. Sometimes we watched documentaries in class which was usually nice except for the one on repressed memories which featured many graphic descriptions of childhood SA with absolutely no trigger warning. The content of this class was the reason I took it despite CTECs saying it was a lot of work and the content was very interesting just not enough to outweigh the cons."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is not an easy seminar at all, in fact quite the opposite. However, it is very interesting and class is usually pretty fun and chill. The teacher is nice and cares about her students. She brings in food all the time which is nice. However, she does have somewhat high expectations, I would say, so grading can be tough. However, she is reasonable, so if you are struggling, just talk to her. Once you know what she is looking for, assignments get easier."
wnbg,psych,101,fall,Harry David Smith,5.80,5.70,5.00,4.30,6.00,3.40,"This is a fantastic seminar, especially if you are truly passionate about talking about music. The psychology content of the course was high–level while still understandable to someone like myself who isn't personally interested in studying psychology. In–class time is almost entirely devoted to discussing various types music, and assignments are essays in the style of psychological research papers. Professor Smith is very passionate about music and constantly keeps everyone engaged and interested in conversations. Grades are based on the essays, and you will do well if you follow the formatting and style guidelines and display interest in the content. Overall, amazing class and could not recommend it more."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course overall was very interesting. I really enjoyed going to class as I knew that our conversations would be very engaging.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Although there was a lot of readings, this class was very chill. The discussions were super interesting and often about videos we watched that linked to the readings. There were 3 papers, but it was very manageable and considered lighter on the writing side in comparison to other seminars. Prof Smith was super nice and gave the whole class an extension on one of the papers. If you have any interest in music, I highly recommend this course because it made me fall in love with listening to music again."
,,,,,,,,,,,I would highly recommend this class to anyone with an interest in music or psychology! The professor was so fun to work with and genuinely kind. The course material was digestible and the work was manageable. I definitely learned a lot more than I was anticipating and I always looked forward to the very enriching discussions.
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!!!! HDS is so amazing I cannot even explain. the classes were so fun and engaging and still managed to teach you about these concepts. if you are interested in music and passionate about it, take this class. you will not regret it!!! there are only 3 essays and none of them are too difficult. meet with HDS if you can if you are unclear about any of the topics."
,,,,,,,,,,,Amazing class if you like music.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class. For someone who hates english classes and had to take one, I'm glad I got to take this one. We literally just talked about and watched videos about music the whole time. I stopped doing the readings like a week in and have not felt behind whatsoever. There are three papers total for the whole course and besides a participation grade, the papers make up the entire grade for the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Smith is amazing. Class discussions were super laid–back and engaging. The work–load isn't bad and there are only 3 essays for the class.
wnbg,psych,101,fall,Ginger Pennington,5.62,5.69,5.69,5.38,5.69,4.85,"Really enjoyed this class, Ginger Pennington was very passionate about what we were learning and it showed. We would have thought out discussions that we all felt we could share what we wanted. The grading is very lenient and she is understanding if we want a better grade. The grades are all from essays or discussions we write having to do with the different subject of feminism that week."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great course. Good discussions and great professor. Dr. Pennington is an amazing professor and person!
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a lot of fun as a freshman and having the girls in my class being my PA group, we were all really close. The course and work is not hard, but there will be times where the readings are dense. Participating in class will really move the discussion and the topics are interesting so I never felt forced to speak."
,,,,,,,,,,,I truly appreciate how the course takes a look at many different perspectives of womanhood and feminism. This kept me and my peers engaged. As a woman of color I really appreciate that intersectionality is an important part of the course and that the discussion is always open to everyone's point of view.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I genuinely loved this class. The discussions were so relevant to modern society, and I always felt comfortable contributing my opinion. We unpacked super interesting topics, and although the discussions were around 80 minutes long, they never felt tiring or forced."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a FANTASTIC seminar. I learned so much from the course. Each week we talked about a different feminist issue and dived deep into it. Prof. Pennington is amazing at facilitating discussions, is SUPER helpful, and is so kind. I really enjoyed this seminar!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was an interesting seminar that was relatively low–stress. There were weekly writing assignments but those were often short and sometimes the readings could get a little bit heavy. There are three papers throughout the quarter, and each one gets longer than the previous one."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class! I loved hearing everything that my classmates got to say, but I also felt a sense of community with the girls in this class. Professor Pennington has a very kind, nurturing demeanor that makes her not only an effective teacher but also a great mentor during your first quarter at Northwestern. This class offers so many stimulating topics to discuss, but it also fosters a great community and space to think freely and bounce ideas off of one another."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course focused on a wide array of topics for women which I thought were all really important to learn about.
,,,,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed the topics in this class! Professor Pennington does a great job directing discussion and provides a unique insight into the issues. Sometimes the assignments were a little disorganized but it was manageable.
,,,,,,,,,,,This course helped me get acclimated to college. Professor Pennington is such a caring an amazing professor and I really felt like she cared about helping all of us get used to college life.
wnbg,psych,101,fall,Benjamin Gorvine,5.90,5.80,5.40,5.10,5.90,5.00,"Professor Gorvine is the SWEETEST!! So easy to talk to and ask for help, always makes class a fun environment by bringing us snacks and smiles, and tries his best to simulate our interest in discussions. Highlights of the course were definitely our dinner outing field trip to Chicago and coming to his place for pizza for our last class :) He is also such a fair and easy grader when it comes to our assignments. Workload was very light as the class consisted of weekly discussions based on readings, a group–led discussion, two short papers, and one long research paper. I will say that the readings were very hard to get through at times, so be prepared for that. But the discussions were very interesting and insightful, nonetheless. I am so glad I got to start my year off with this seminar!"
,,,,,,,,,,,I enjoyed the group learning environment and felt there was a lot of guidance for a first quarter class at Northwestern. Professor Gorvine is very kind and welcoming professor.
,,,,,,,,,,,THIS COURSE IS AMAZING. Professor is AMAZING! He's so nice and understanding. The course itself is extremely interesting with easy texts. This course is also an easy A.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was extremely light and I am very glad that I took this seminar out of all the other seminars that were there. There were two essays, one final paper, and a presentation and readings here and there."
,,,,,,,,,,,This was by far my favorite course this quarter. Professor Gorvine is a great instructor and keeps the content engaging throughout. The readings can be fast paced but they are interesting and engaging in themselves. Thoroughly enjoyed the course content.
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Gorvine is such a blessing to do a freshman seminar with. He truly cares for you and your wellbeing. The material covered in the course is pretty interesting too.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Loved this seminar. Work was super manageable. Class discussions were pretty interesting. Gorvine is super nice and helpful. Overall really fun experience, take this seminar!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very fun seminar and I would highly recommend. The readings can be dry or boring, but discussions are interesting and work load isn't all that bad. You write 3 papers (one of them is a longer research paper) and have a prepare a group led discussion, but none of these are particularly awful to do. Also there's an ""academic field trip"" to Chicago to eat try out foods."
,,,,,,,,,,,Take this seminar. Professor Gorvine is an amazing instructor and advisor. He truly loves his students and does his best to assist his students. Readings are pretty easy compared to other seminars and he is lenient when it comes to grading papers.
wnbg,psych,110,fall,Wendi Gardner,5.62,5.34,5.35,4.32,5.34,4.44,"This course was amazing! Professor Gardner is an excellent, engaging lecturer. She explained concepts clearly and with enthusiasm that just made learning it more fun. The class was also just entertaining, as she connected concepts with real–life examples which also helped us prepare for exams. Also, the 3 exams were noncumulative, which made it easier to know what to study. She also offered plenty of extra credit opportunities, which actually did help reinforce the material and was not too time–consuming. This class definitely isn't an ""easy A"" (you still have to study and understand all the concepts to do well on exams) but so long as you attend lectures and actively listen, you will be fine. Highly recommend this course taught by Professor Gardner!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked this class overall. Professor Gardner is definitely passionate about the subject and I really like her lecture style. She also posts all of her lectures to Canvas after class so its easy to review the material. The only downside to this class is how high the exams are weighted (but I guess that's a common thing in college). Our assignments were worth about 3–5 points but the 3 exams were each worth 80. So if you bomb an exam, it will be extremely hard to make it up through assignments alone. Gardner does offer 3 extra credit assignments (worth 2 points) so those could help boost the grade a little. Another issue I had was with her Exam Viewing. After each exam she gives the opportunity for us to view our exams and see what questions we missed/ask questions. However, she only did this for the first exam (out of 3), the other 2 she never opened exam viewing times?? Overall though, very enjoyable course. You will do fine if you keep up with the assignments and STUDY FOR THE EXAMS!!!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is structured in a very lecture–heavy/based way. I enjoy the lectures and found that the way in which they are applied to our lives tends to help memorize material. However, there is quite a bit of material and the class goes by fairly quickly so you definitely want to make sure that you pay attention and study early."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was very straightforward. If you pay attention to the lecture and study a decent amount, you can do well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is super interesting, with an amazing professor, and being in a class with a really passionate teacher makes the class even better. Wendi is adorable and loves what she does and I would recommend this class to anyone regardless of true interest in psychology. There is no homework and the exams are pretty simple: all multiple choice (which can be great for some people, but not great for others depending on the person). Overall the class is super easy to manage and really entertaining."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course gave me a solid introduction to psychology. Not overly easy, not overly complicated. Just a great, solid course."
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this course. I enjoyed the three tests throughout the course rather than a giant paper or final. It was super interesting and a nice change to be in a big lecture room.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is pretty easy. There are just 3 exams and they aren’t cumulative. The other grades materials are reading quizzes and discussion posts. You don’t need to do all of the readings to do well in the class. Lectures are fine— it’s purely the professor talking for the hour and twenty minutes, which could get boring sometimes."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was interesting. If you took AP Psychology in high school you will know most of the material. The professor was great and the lab requirement wasn’t that bad.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a somewhat easy A, the tests are what I expected them to be and as long as you memorize the content from the slides you should be good. I was satisfied with it overall, there's not much work on a weekly basis and Gardner is a good lecturer, she makes the content engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Wendi is such an amazing lecturer and really gets you excited about psychology! Exams are super fair, and not at all challenging if you attend lectures/do the little bits of assigned reading."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was simply amazing. Professor Gardner really cares about her students and wants to see them succeed. The midterms are non–cumulative and cover exactly what Professor Gardner says they will cover—there are no tricks. I studied quite a bit for midterms, but outside of that, there was little work required on a weekly basis."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Gardner is a great lecturer. The TAs weren’t super organized or helpful. Pretty boring course, but relatively painless."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Gardner will post slides online after class, so just need to study from her slides + book (topics she didn't cover in class, but will only take up 10–20% of the exam). Exam is always 50 MCQ and is pretty easy as long as you prepare for it. There are 3 extra credit papers where you have to write a letter and be their 'psychologist' by including topics learned in class. Overall a chill class and Professor Gardner is a very sweet lady!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good introductory course. A lot of material was covered, but it didn't seem too overwhelming. The workload was not intense at all and the information was interesting. We couldn't go in depth about anything and there were some subjects that we skipped over, but that is to be expected with an intro course. Prof. Gardner was a decent lecturer and I was fairly engaged, but some days can be a bit monotonous with an 1h+ of lecture. There were three exams and no final, which was great, and they weren't too difficult. This is a good choice if you're a bit interested in the subject matter and want a less intensive course."
,,,,,,,,,,,The professor was very enthusiastic and seemed to enjoy teaching. The content is also pretty easy to learn if you put in the effort (flashcards)
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class – it's an easy A. There are 3 exams throughout the quarter, 1 discussion post every week, 1 Canvas quiz every week, and 3 extra credit papers throughout the quarter. Don't stress about the Canvas quizzes. There is no time limit and all the answers are on the slideshows. You have to study for the three exams – however – if you study, there is no reason you can't get an A on every one. Just make flashcards using the slideshows and textbook. Also: the professor is great! Wendi is so nice, and it's clear she genuinely wants everyone to succeed in her class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really liked this course!! Professor Gardner has the best energy and is really approachable. She went through information pretty fast, but that was to be expected. As long as you listen and write down anything that she doesn't already say on her slides then you should be fine. Her slide shows say all the important things. This was a great introduction to psychology!! I really want to take another psychology course after taking this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think, overall, it's a great class! Professor Gardner is really engaging in class. Despite how big the class is, it's really hard to not focus on her because of how interesting the class is (and how fun the professor is). The homework is easy, you just need to memorize lots of stuff. I really like how the class is structured with three non–cumulative tests, which really helped reduce my anxiety of tests."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Intro to Psych with Professor Gardner was an amazing introduction to classes at Northwestern. I think Professor Gardner is someone all Northwestern professors should strive to emulate. She made every single lecture so engaging, and outside of class, the quizzes (open–note and untimed) were perfect reviews. Similarly, the exams were not cumulative, so very forgiving especially if you are someone still developing study skills. I highly recommend this class with Gardner."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This introductory course gave a great overview of various psychological concepts. Professor Gardner lectures very well and you can tell that she wants her students to learn. She shows up everyday excited to teach and she engages with the students. You learn so much in class that all you really need to do to be successful is to pay attention and to do the readings that she assigns. There is not much work outside of class other than completing the weekly quizzes (open note) and discussions along with studying for the 3 midterms. Additionally, there are 3 extra credit opportunities that are actually fun. I highly recommend taking this class and especially with Professor Gardner if you can!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course, the material was engaging and professor Gardner was great."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As a required class for psych, it's a really good intro class and Prof. Gardner does a really amazing job engaging the class in every topic. Even if you aren't a psych major, this is a really good class to take, regardless."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Gardner is amazing!! The workload is very reasoning and the lectures were engaging.
,,,,,,,,,,,"professor gardner is amazing! her lectures are really organized and the examples/games she discusses in class really help understand the content. the discussion boards and open book quizzes are a really great way to boost your grade, and even the 3 midterms are not too tough if you go through lecture notes and slides. overall, this is a great distro to take."
,,,,,,,,,,,"THIS CLASS IS AMAZING. Incredibly doable, lots of extra credit, and Wendy has my whole heart. 10/10 no critiques, chef's kiss. There are 3 exams but all of them are MC and not challenging :)"
,,,,,,,,,,,The class is pretty nice. Gardner is kind and a very good teacher. Class consists of three non–cumulative exams and weekly discussion posts. Exams were more difficult than I'd expect. But not impossible. Definitely recommend studying for each exam for more than a day though. Consistent workload but never thought of it as difficult. Not an easy A but definitely possible.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think this was a good class, and the tests were not too difficult. There were four extra credit opportunities, a discussion post every week, and a weekly online lecture quiz. Psych 110 with Renee was much more entertaining but Wendi is easier to receive an A."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I very much enjoyed this class during this quarter. The lectures were interesting and engaging and the teacher was great at conveying information. The assignments included 3 extra credit papers and a weekly quiz every Sunday which was open note with only 3–5 questions with an unlimited time limit. There are 3 midterms and the lectures provide you with all the information you need to do well. Make sure to read the sections of the textbook that the teachers tells you to because there are very specific questions on the midterms regarding that information. Overall, this was a great distribution requirement and I highly recommend it for anyone who is interested."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was a bit more work than I had anticipated, especially because of the research and lab requirements. Overall, the professor was great and content was interesting. The exams were also very straightforward."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was interesting and even as someone who had no high school basis in Psychology, it was doable. The textbook is almost not worth the investment. Reading the sections on the study guide (~6 per exam) is enough to get you through."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm in McCormick, so maybe I don't have the best opinion to listen to here, but if you aren't interested in psychology, then this class is not an easy A. The lectures are engaging and everything, and it's fun to learn about psychology, but when it comes time to sit down and memorize everything for the exams, it's just a little overwhelming. The A cutoff is a 94%, and you need to take into account that this class is weighted 80% off of the three exams, which consist of 50 question multiple choice tests. That means each question on the exams is worth half a percent of your final grade. Miss 12 combined questions, and boom, you now have an A–. This class has basically no work outside of class, and all you need to worry about are the exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was super engaging and fun! I loved hearing the studies that correlated with discussion topics because it put it in applicable processes. Prof. Gardner is the sweetest and makes everything relatable and genuinely wants to see you do well in the class by adding office hours before exams and giving personal examples from her own life to help give us context clues.
,,,,,,,,,,,Didn’t learn a lot. Could have just read through Wikipedia. Not an easy A if you don’t have any background knowledge in psychology and biology.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked this course a lot. It’s not very intellectually challenging, just a lot of terms and memorization, but it was still an amazing class and Wendy Gardner is great. Super engaging lectures and tests weren’t very hard"
,,,,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed this course. I learned a lot and the professor is very engaged when teaching. She provides examples and is an absolute joy. The work load was good too.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Gardner was really great, and all the things we learned are core and will stick with you. Great course!"
,,,,,,,,,,,The lectures were engaging and fun. Slides were useful and concise. Loved Gardner as an instructor too
,,,,,,,,,,,I thought this course would not be stimulating because I had learned all the concepts already but I was pleasantly engaged for almost all of the lectures.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a lot of information but definitely manageable; the key factor is going to lecture!! Because outside of that, I did not need to do that much studying; rather, I just had to review my notes from lecture."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I am not a big fan of psychology, but the class was doable. It is a lot of memorization and studying, but not too much work that is due each week. A– is manageable, but it is tougher to get an A."
,,,,,,,,,,,material is interesting and presented clearly and entertainingly
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was one of my favorite classes. I often didn't get perfect scores (my fault) but the lectures were really interesting and engaging. You can honestly do really well in this class if you show up to lectures and pay attention. I have a few pieces of advice, take really good notes in your own words and use flashcards to study. Also, do not skip reading the textbook because there will always be questions from it on the exams. Take the mini quizzes and discussions very seriously, they add up and can be worth the same as an exam."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course with Professor Gardner. She is so sweet and is a really engaging lecturer. I recommend taking this class with her if you can. The class was not too hard, there was barely any homework, but the tests were a little challenging. Definitely make sure you study everything you learn for them and you will do well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really loved this class. Professor Gardner was wonderful, and every lecture was extremely interesting. Gardner was very accommodating, and she never gave assignments that were too time consuming. She also gave out a lot of extra credit, and the three exams were very fair. There was no final exam, which I really appreciated."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I genuinely looked forward to this class. The professor is so passionate about the subject and does a great job making the class interesting with real–world examples. Before taking this class, I was unsure if I wanted to pursue a psychology major, but now I definitely want to. The workload is definitely manageable (one open–note, online quiz and discussion post per week) although studying for exams (there are three) requires a lot of memorization of notes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Gardner made the content very approachable. I like how she simplified topics into more easy to understand ideas, and it didn't really feel like she oversimplified things either. The weekly discussion post was very non–demanding, just a couple sentences once a week. And the exams were pretty straightforward, very similar to the weekly quizzes."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Gardner is a fantastic lecturer. Her lectures were really engaging at all times.
,,,,,,,,,,,"There were not a lot of ways to get points except the 3 exams over the quarter and the 5 point quizzes and 2 point discussion posts. There were 3–4 extra credit papers but they were only worth 2 points each. However, the class was engaging and very interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,TAKE THIS CLASS WITH GARDNER!!!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not a guaranteed easy A, but if you go to class and study the materials she provides, you're at least guaranteed an A–. There are online weekly quizzes which have no time limit and boost your grade and 3 extra credit opportunities. I recommend doing all of the extra credit and read the textbook before exams, especially the portions she puts on the study guide. Lectures aren't recorded, but 90% of the exam materials are on the slides which she posts and 9% is on the textbook, and honestly the other 1% is random. There's 3 exams, all non–cumulative, no final. Exams are pretty straightforward. Material is super interesting, but it is dense considering there's a lot of information to memorize. She simplifies it in lectures so I'd definitely go, but otherwise you need to set at least 2–3 days to study for exams and you'll be fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,Overall I genuinely loved this course. The material is really interesting and Prof. Gardner teaches it in an incredibly engaging manner. Overall I found every lecture actually enjoyable. Prof. Gardner is amazing and provides multiple extra credit opportunities.
,,,,,,,,,,,The course was the perfect balance of memorization and knowing concepts. I learned a lot about a broad variety of psychology topics. Very interesting and fun class
,,,,,,,,,,,"I feel that I got a good overview of psychology through this course, and was able to figure out whether or not this subject was something I wanted to explore further. Also, Wendi was an amazing professor– she was always very helpful, made sure all the concepts made sense, and always had a smile on her face which was a great way to start the day. The coursework was not bad by any means, just a weekly open note quiz and discussion post, but the tests were pretty difficult– you have to study a lot. Otherwise, it was a great intro course that I would recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a good course! I learned a lot about different areas within psychology. Professor Wendi Gardner is great! She's super enthusiastic, which made for very engaging lectures. The format is three midterms (no final), weekly online open–note quizzes, and 3–4 extra credit assignments. The exams were quite fair but they tested very specific information on the slides, so I definitely recommend studying the slides thoroughly for the exams. A lot of the questions on exams involve applying concepts/definitions to real–world scenarios, so I recommend studying with friends so you can make questions for each other. Getting an A requires at least a 94%, so I would do the extra credit papers to boost your grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a great class and as long as you study for the tests you are guaranteed at least a B. There are four extra credit opportunities and there are three noncumulative tests that are sometimes curved depending on the highest score. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in psychology.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Wendy was a great professor who clearly had a lot of passion teaching the subject. Slides are straightforward, and all (non–cumulative) exams were based on the slide content. Lectures are enjoyable, but speed of teaching can be fast at times. Thankfully, you can always just go back and review the slides in your free time."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was amazing! Would definitely recommend. Professor Gardner is a very good lecturer. She was always very enthusiastic and often engaged us by coming up with small and short experiments that we could try in our seats. The material can be a bit boring at first, but it gets more interesting later on. The exams are all multiple choice and are definitely manageable if you studied."
,,,,,,,,,,,I love Wendi!!! Take her class! I found it super easy because Wendi's lectures were great and the material was pretty intuitive. The work outside of class was really minimal: a short discussion post and open notes canvas mini quiz once a week and studying for the 3 non–cummulitive exams was the only work I had.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed the class, Professor Garder was always entertaining while giving her lectures and made the class fun. She gave various assignment opportunities that help you prepare for the exam including mini quizzes, extra credit, and discussion boards"
,,,,,,,,,,,I really appreciated the organization of this course. I was easily able to complete tasks outside of class because I had a clear idea of what was expected of me.
,,,,,,,,,,,More interesting than I thought! Solid course
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved Professor Gardner's class. I will forever recommend it to other students. While it can be a lot of memorization, the exams were very fair and there was never anything not on the slides/ the textbook included on the exam. She gives several opportunities for extra credit papers as well as little assignments to boost your grade. It was very engaging and a fun class."
,,,,,,,,,,,TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR GARDNER!! I absolutely loved this course– it was everything that I imagined it to be and more!! The fact that there were only three midterms and no final meant that the workload was evenly distrubited across the quarter
,,,,,,,,,,,"The aspects that I liked about this class: the timing is really nice (11:00 is not too late and not too early), the teacher is really understanding, promotes thought and always takes on question, and TAs were really nice too."
,,,,,,,,,,,very interesting material and engaging lectures; i wish i paid attention more bc it's actually fun
,,,,,,,,,,,I enjoyed the content and the way the professor connected everything back to something the students could relate to.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course workload outside of class is very light, but the textbook is great and definitely read it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Gardner is a good lecturer. She always tried to use vivid examples to illustrate abstract concepts, which really helped me memorize them. many people mentioned in CTEC that this is an easy A class. Well, I felt that you still need to put in effort in memorizing tons of info and concepts before exams. The quarter system made the classes went really fast, so I think that it would help to have some basis of psych and bio before. Overall this class is very organized: Discussion post/wk, open note quiz/wk, 3 exams and 3 extra credit papers which were not hard to write."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course was generally very simple––weekly open note quizzes and discussions, 4 extra credit opportunities, and 3 midterms. If you took AP Psychology in high school, a lot of the content was review. Professor Gardner is a really good professor and you can tell she is very excited to teach the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was lecture based but was not remotely boring because of the fast pace and engaging lectures
,,,,,,,,,,,I learned a lot of information. Lectures were very engaging and tests were multiple choice. Homework was minimal. As long as you studied for tests and focused in lectures the class was very manageable and interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Gardner always had very organized powerpoints, and it was always clear what you needed to have covered for examinations. Powerpoints included many examples which helped you to apply concepts that you learned in class on examinations. She also has book study guides where she includes the specific book lessons that you want to learn. I would say it is best to focus on anything that is central in the lesson, as the class focuses on broader concepts than tiny details. Prof. Gardner is also a very passionate professor. Therefore, I was able to learn more easily just by sitting and listening to her lectures rather than taking notes during class. Powerpoints were posted after class, so it was very easy to focus on her lecture and maybe jot down a few notes on what she was saying rather than what was on the slides. She does not deviate much from what is on the slides. There were multiple extra credit opportunities that are not difficult if you take a good hour or two to thoughtfully complete. I would say start out doing them and then you can decide whether or not you need them later in the course. The worst feeling is not doing them at first and then having to settle for a lower grade. There were also easy discussions and mini quizzes that were very simple and open notes. Lab requirement was very interesting and gives you a feel for what psychological research is if you are interested. It is the easiest way to fulfill your research requirement and you have to be 18 or older. If younger, you have to write a research paper. This is a GREAT class to take to get a feel for psychology and Gardner is THE BEST."
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a FANTASTIC course. Prof. Gardner is so nice and helpful and she was such an engaging professor. Tests are completely reasonable and I found the material really interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"good class, interesting content. teacher is obviously passionate about the subject, and workload is manageable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course is a great introduction to Psychology as it summarizes its main branches, fields and terminology. However, there isn’t a lot of depth in some interesting parts of the content as there is a lot to cover."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I recommend this class as a intro. The instruction is clear, the workload is moderate to low, and the professor is engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was great. The lectures cover almost everything that goes in the tests and they are really easy to follow. It was very engaging and fun.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a great introduction to psychology. It helped me decide which topics in psychology I'm interested in and provided a great overview of a lot of different concepts. Prof Gardner is very sweet and does a good job explaining everything. There are 3 exams and we were done with the class before thanksgiving which is such a relief. There are also 3 extra credit papers if you need to boost your score. There is a ""mini quiz"" each week that motivates you to go over the material and stay on track. Even though she uploads all the slides on canvas I would advise you to go to class because you do have to remember every single detail for the exams and you just learn more in class than the information on the slides. I think this class was totally fair and low–stress. There is a lab component which is kind of annoying to do (basically you have to participate in studies that are usually a bunch of repetitive surveys)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course is excellent for anyone who wants to take a depth/introduction to psych. Professor Gardner's enthusiasm summarizes her love for the subject and motivates us to pay attention in class. The only ""issue"" that I faced was with the extensive tests involving a lot of memorization. Besides, that is a great intro class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great class. It helps to have some psych knowledge prior to the course but you’ll be more than fine without it. As long as you go to class, take good notes in class, and study in advance (not just definitions, but for application) you’ll do well. BE SURE TO READ THE TEXTBOOK CHAPTERS AS INSTRUCTED."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The content was interesting and all made sense but there's a difference between understanding everything and remembering everything. The weekly homework is super manageable with a discussion post and open–note mini quiz every week and the exams weren't super challenging, but I spent hours memorizing for the exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a large lecture class with scantron tests and I didn't retain very much information – you get what you sign up for. However, it wasn't difficult and I am still interested in taking psych classes in the future. It gets the job done, and you will be just fine and stress–free if you choose to take this class with Wendi, just make sure you also take some other discussion classes because it's easy to feel a bit lost on the connection front since the class truly is massive."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gardener is super sweet and the exams are fairly easy. Overall, very enjoyable class! I decided to major (or at least minor) in psychology after taking this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course because of Prof Gardner. She made every lecture very interesting and connected it to real–world applications. As long as you're taking notes in the lectures and reading/taking notes on the textbook sections that she highlights as important for the exams, you will do just fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall a really great intro class –– the discussion requirements on canvas were extremely manageable as long as you remembered to do them on time. The mini quizzes were all open note and acted as good check–ins throughout the quarter. The three non–cumulative exams were all multiple choice and pretty intuitive, so if you put in effort to study the main concepts and read the specific textbook sections she posts, they're not bad at all. The course concepts were well structured in that they were grouped together in a logical way."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Gardner made psychology very interested. I highly recommend this class as a distro. Topics are very applicable to life
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a great class!! Super engaging and not very difficult.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was very interesting. I learned important information that is relevant and important in everyday life. I would recommend taking this course not just for a major/ minor or distro requirement but because a lot of valuable information is taught. This includes learning techniques, ways to manage stress, and personality traits. The course was not a huge time commitment. It consisted of a lab component (14 hours of participation in studies or a 15–page research paper). You have to do the paper if you are under 18, which I was, so if you can take the class when you are 18 or older. The class was easy and a good distro to take as it is not too hard. I took this as a theme requirement for McCormick and recommend it! Take it with Gardner she is the best!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lab requirement and additional textbook readings are a bit much. Lectures are doable, but you don't really need to go to lecture because all the information is on the slides."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Loved this class, professor was also super knowledgeable and the course material was very well taught"
,,,,,,,,,,,eh
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Gardner is amazing!!! I loved this class. I also didn't think it was hard, especially because there are a lot of extra credit opportunities. This is a very complete introduction to Psychology and an interesting class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a great distro if you have it with Wendi Gardner. She is an amazing professor, so great at lecturing. She knows all the slides and content by heart so she's not reading the slides, she's walking around and making it interesting rather than the usual boring drawl. Even though the slides are posted after class, you should go to lecture because she's an amazing lecturer, you will understand concepts better if you go, and the slides can be somewhat hard to interpret without her lecturing. Psych topics are mostly interesting and very applicable to things you see in real life. Wendi specifies which textbook sections you need to read because they'll be on the test, and there aren't many. Textbook can also be found for free online. One short discussion board post and response, plus a 5 question open–note quiz due per week. Very quick and not much work at all. There are three non–cumulative midterm exams which are fair and not hard but require memorization of ~120 vocab terms for each which will take several hours if you do it the night before. No final which is nice. Great class overall, especially the professor."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a very great intro to psychology course that covers a wide range of topics. Everything is lecture based with some minimal textbook readings with each unit. Topics covered are all very interesting and explained properly. Professor Gardener has many office hours as so the TAs. Questions on the exams can be worded tricky. Weekly quizzes are open note and from the lectures. I learned so much this quarter and recommend this class to anyone.
,,,,,,,,,,,this was a great and very interesting class. it was engaging and made it very easy to stay present during a long class. It also moved through topics very easily
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a basic intro to psychology class, and you could tell Garner is passionate and excited about the topic, and she is excited to share that passion with students. The three midterms and no final was nice because there was a lot of content we covered, but it was not cumulative between midterms. They also weren't hard as long as you put in the time to learn the concepts, which also weren't that bad. Garner is also super sweet and makes herself and the TAs very available right before office hours. Her lectures were informative, and made it so you didn't need to read as much of the textbook, but she did just read right off of her slides without adding much extra information, which sometimes made it difficult to stay focused for the entire class period."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor is so sweet and made the material enjoyable to learn. Sometimes the slides were organized kinda weirdly tho/was hard to follow. But overall easy class, as long as you pay attention in lecture and study for exams"
,,,,,,,,,,,Class was very manageable and fairly easy if you went to lectures and can memorize information. Very similar to AP Psych with more details and information.
,,,,,,,,,,,The grade is comprised of 3 multiple choice tests that make up 90% of your grade. They are so much harder than they need to be.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was all around very pleasant. Professor Gardner is a fantastic instructor and shows a lot of passion for the subject, making things very easy to understand. The weekly online quizzes helped reinforce ideas, and while the discussion boards and lab requirement may feel a bit tedious, they're nothing to stress about as long as you stay on top of them. Would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject or wanting to fulfill a requirement."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a very nice class! I didn't realize I already fulfilled my distro req. for this area so I didn't have to actually take this course, however, I did very much enjoy it. The exams are fair and have funny examples. The lectures are very interesting and Wendi really does care for her students."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really liked this course, and it was very manageable this quarter. The lectures were interesting and Professor Gardner is usually very engaging and gives a lot of cool examples and demonstrations that help you really remember the information. It's an intro course, so it's likely like you'll recognize at least a few of the concepts that are covered, which is nice. As long as you take notes/pay attention during class and study for a few hours during the exam, you should be ok. There are a few little assignments every week that are easy to forget about if you aren't careful. Part of your credit is participating in lab studies (or an essay if you don't want to) and I thought that part of the class was really interesting and I didn't have to go too out of my way to get the credits done in time. This class made me want to take more psych classes! Highly recommend it, especially if you're interested in psych."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class taught but Gardner is fantastic, she teaches really well and the info is really interesting. I highly recommend taking this class, you will learn so many interesting things and people's actions will make more sense."
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof. Gardener is a really enthusiastic teacher and will go out of her way to explain the topics on her slides. Her slides are also interesting and concise. Reading the slides and the selected readings she gives from the textbook for a weekend before the exam should get you an A.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Wendy is an amazing lecturer! She has so much energy and enthusiasm for the material, which really helped me engage in the huge class more. The work outside of class was easy to do and the lab work was pretty manageable. The class gave me a great introduction to general psychology and it really made me excited about the subject. I would highly recommend taking this class as it is fun and even the exams are manageable if you study."
,,,,,,,,,,,There is a lot of content covered over a short span of time yet Gardner does a great job in making each topic memorable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was VERY much lecture based which I am not the biggest fan of, though that is subjective. The instructor did try to incorporate student participation every once in a while."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was course is a great introductory course and there is a lot to learn from it. The professor is always willing to explain further if you do not understand the material. Overall, I thought it was a great first experience into a Northwestern course because you were challenged yet offered enough support and information to somewhat succeed."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gardner is absolutely wonderful and makes lessons engaging and fun. Work is manageable, exams are non–cumulative, and homework is minimal. Learned a lot from this class and have applied some of it to my own day–to–day life. Highly recommend. Extra credit papers were also surprisingly fun. I recommend doing them."
,,,,,,,,,,,very interesting class I wish I had taken sooner. learned a lot and lectures were very engaging. professor made class fun and interesting too
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was pretty interesting! And pretty easy. I personally didn't read the textbook until the study guide for it was posted, but I would recommend staying on top of that better. Reviewing the info as the quarter goes on rather than waiting till the exams is the move. It was interesting, very intro, but good."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was not super interested in psychology before taking this course, but it was really good. I learned a lot about the basics of psychology and the brain, and the lectures were all pretty interesting. It was also a fairly easy distro requirement."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is a great intro to psych, but also if you want to fulfill a distro! The time commitment is very low aside from studying before exams, the content is really interesting, and Professor Gardner is a great lecturer. She explains even complicated concepts so they are easy to grasp and she uses a lot of real–world examples, which is very helpful. She’s so good that I haven’t even had to go to any office hours, but she and the TAs are very easy to reach."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There are 3 exams that make up the majority of your grade. They are non–cumulative, which is nice, and if you’ll do well if you go over your lecture notes and the textbook chapters (the professor will specify which chapters you need to read and which ones you can skip so you don’t have to waste time reading the whole thing)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The only thing that is annoying about this class is the lab requirement. You have to do about 7 hours of lab participation, where you basically act as a guinea pig for the grad students. At times, the people organizing the study can be inflexible and uncaring of your time or schedule. However, other than that this is a great class, I highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course provided a great survey on essential introductory topics in psychology. The material (lectures and readings) was interesting, and the workload was very manageable. In the class, we had 3 non–cumulative exams, weekly open–note mini–quizzes, weekly discussion posts and responses, and extra credit opportunities."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class for a distro. You will learn a lot and might even consider a minor in Psych. The tests are basically all of your grades so make sure to study with friends and speak about concepts. If you know the slides and read the book, you will do well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was genuinely surprised by how much I actually learned from this course and how often I felt like I walked out of lecture smarter and more knowledgeable about the concepts we covered. It is also nice because beyond the first day, lecture was not mandatory and the slides and textbook were perfect in preparing you for the test. The non–cumulative exam style also really took the pressure off and made this a wonderful course for the first quarter of college. Content is intuitive, although some things are rote memorization. Flash cards/Anki deck will go a long way to get you through the class. Dr. Gardner is honestly one of the most fantastic professors."
,,,,,,,,,,,There are three non–cumulative tests based purely on the slide information and a few sections of the textbook which she tells us we need to read (only a few that she explicitly says though). They were all multiple choice tests and I liked the non–cumulative aspect of it. Try to get the lab component done early. I would not recommend taking this class if you are under 18 because then you have to write a really long paper for the lab requirement instead of just taking a few surveys.
,,,,,,,,,,,I liked the course content in the way that they were very applicable to our as college students lives.
,,,,,,,,,,,Overall this was a great course to try and find out if psychology is something that interests you. The class is built out of 300 points and the exams carry most of the weight of the course. The structure of the class heavily relies on memory recall as the exams are multiple choice and filled with all the content from the lectures. The lectures Prof Gardner gave were great and would highly recommend taking her section.
,,,,,,,,,,,I found this course extremely interesting and I learned a ton from it.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was great! Professor Gardner is SO NICE and was always happy to answer questions. Her office hours, especially the Zoom ones before exams, were SO HELPFUL. She's super enthusiastic about psychology, so it made the lectures super interesting. There isn't much weekly work, aside from a short quiz and discussion post, and then there's a study guide from the textbook (which tells you exactly what you need to read for the exam) and a short extra credit assignment per exam. I think I spent more time on this class than others, as it didn't come super naturally to me, but it was my most interesting class for sure. I found some new study strategies that worked great, like making a Quizlet, saying the content out loud to myself, and doing active recall questions was super helpful and made the content so much easier on exam day. Also, the exams are all multiple–choice, so, overall, this was a great class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was absolutely phenomenal. It was a fun course that included some incredible topics that also applied to us as students. That was something that really jumped out to me, was how she always made sure the topics roped back around to us. The topics in the course are easy to digest and understand and can be committed to memory pretty quickly. The exams and practice quizzes were all very fair in testing the material and were honestly fun at times. I never did the extra credit materials but they seemed like a fun way to practice putting context into the things we learned in class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Gardner is just the BEST and her passion for teaching really inspired me. I felt triggered to keep up studying psychology in college even though it was never an option to me. Classes are really easy–going and, if you focus on the slides and study–guides for exams, it is really ok getting an A. There are also extra–credits for improving grade. I think 85% of the course is AWESOME and the remaining percentage is kind of boring. But, in general, if you want to explore psych that's the perfect class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed how this course briefly covers many topics, as it is an introduction course. And it lets new psych students know which topic suits them the most"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Gardner is the best! the course covers basics of psych topics, it is nice but not ground breaking but what else would you expect from intro class. I was really looking forward to every single class cause it was easy and fun. Especially with prof Gardner that is just so awesome and makes the lectures really interesting"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked this class. I learned a lot about psychology and Professor Gardner was a really engaging teacher. There are 3 non–cumulative exams, and they do require you to memorize information. If you want to do well on them, you have to listen and review your notes. I think memorizing the terms for each exam was really important."
,,,,,,,,,,,This was definitely the most fair class I have taken this quarter
,,,,,,,,,,,The exams are tough but fair
,,,,,,,,,,,There is no final exam which is great and the lectures aren't bad at all
,,,,,,,,,,,"Psych 110 is a memorization based class. It has very interesting material and concepts relating to everything from memory to disorders, that you can apply to your own life. However, within the class with each midterm you are simply tasked to memorize terms learned then replace them next midterm with new terms."
,,,,,,,,,,,"You have to earn an A, the tests are pretty tricky and the best way to study is in groups. Make sure to read the textbook because she tests it"
,,,,,,,,,,,I enjoyed this course! The content was intriguing and I felt that I learned a lot about human nature in general.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I took this class as a distro and came in with basically no prior knowledge of psychology. Professor Gardner is clearly very passionate about the topic, which came across in her lectures. I was a little nervous about how big the class was, but she did a good job of still encouraging student participation and questions. She also used the large class size for mini psychology demonstrations during some lectures which was fun. The three tests are very manageable as long as you attend the lectures and take good notes. There is also a textbook for the class, but I found that I did not have to use it as long as I went to the lectures. The lab component involved participating in grad student research, which was exciting and not too time consuming. There are also three extra credit papers throughout the quarter, which I really appreciated!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is really great if you're looking for something that won't take too much time outside of class. There is just one min quiz, one short discussion post and one discussion reply due every week. There are 3 non–cumulative multiple–choice exams. They require memorization, and you will do best if you start studying well before them. Still, I did most of my studying 1 or 2 days before them and did pretty well. There are also extra credit papers! Prof. Gardner is lovely and the course gives you lots of easy opportunities to improve your grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course covered a variety of topics within psychology that made me want to learn more about the subject and take further courses in the future. It was a great way to become familiar with various areas of psychology.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not that easy a at all may be a easy be, but the professor is pretty enthusiastic and good at answering questions but you got a study a lot for this course"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is a stellar introduction to Psychology. As someone with basically no interest in Psychology prior to taking this course, I was pleasantly surprised by the content of the course – it was captivating, interesting, and pretty easy to digest. I love the fact that I can now pull up random Psychology facts in my conversation. This course would be great on it's own, however Professor Gardner makes it fantastic. Every lecture is like she is giving a performance. You can tell that she loves the subject by the enthusiasm she has. She is a fantastic teacher, and the way she teaches really implants the concepts into your mind. She tends to elaborate beyond the contents of the slides, so each lecture is a must attend. That being said, you don't want to miss a lecture because it is so captivating. The Lab portion of the course is my only complaint. It's not that it's difficult, it's just a bit overwhelming. My email inbox was just flooded with studies to participate in, which was as equally annoying as stressful. That being said, it's definitely the easiest lab you could ask for – for the most part it is just filling out surveys. Overall, this course is a 10/10. I would recommend taking it to anyone who needs to lighten their schedule or wants a really good professor."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Gardner is an absolutely adorable delight to have in class. Her lectures are enjoyable and engaging, and her energy and interest make it easy to fall in love with both the class and psychology as a whole. The homework is extremely light (the weekly assignments shouldn't take longer than twenty minutes MAX), just make sure to pay attention in the lectures and study well for the exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a great course and I highly recommend it. Professor Gardners does a great job teaching and keeps each lecture interesting. It is also nice that there are mini–quizzes throughout the course and chances for extra credit papers on top of the 3 exams.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I felt like this was a great course to take as an introduction to the field of psychology. It was exactly what I was looking for in that type of course, and it got me interested in taking more psychology classes in the future."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVED this class! I definitely recommend it for anyone wanting an interesting but relatively easy distro class. Professor Gardner was so nice and fun to talk to, and she made each lecture interesting and interactive. Her slides were all very clear and concise and made it easy to understand the material. Before exams, she lets you know exactly which sections of which textbook chapters you will be tested on, so if you are tight for time, you only need to read those sections (and they are always very short), but if you do want to read the text book, it is actually interesting and not a bad read like some other class textbooks are. The tests in this class were all multiple choice and were not challenging if you knew the material, and they were easy to study for because its very clear exactly what content will be on the test. We had weekly discussion posts and open note quizzes, but those were all straight forward and pretty simple. Over all, it was a really really great class and Professor Gardner is amazing!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"THIS COURSE WAS THE BEST ONE I TOOK YET! I loved every part of it, would change absolutely nothing. It was so interesting yet the workload was not bad at all. I am so glad I took this course, it actually changed me and Professor Gardner was absolutely wonderful. Thank you!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gardner was great and very engaging! The only thing was there was not a lot of time between tests so I found myself having to cram and missing class was okay, she just does say more in–person than what is on the slides."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is amazing! Prof Gardner does a great job structuring an interesting and organized course. I learned a lot! 3 exams, with weekly quizzes + discussion posts online. There is also room for extra credit. This class is not an ""easy"" A because a lot of memorization is required."
,,,,,,,,,,,"A quick tour through psychology. There are weekly quizzes that have a few weird questions, but discussion posts are easy. The three midterms had a few difficult/tricky questions but you can almost always narrow them down to two or three answers and then just best guess your way to an A."
,,,,,,,,,,,"What makes this class so great for first–years, especially, is that you get exposed to what a good lecture course is like. Professor Gardner shows genuine enthusiasm for psychology. Her lectures are very interesting, not too fast–paced or slow, and she pauses throughout the class to answer any questions. I would highly recommend taking this course with Professor Gardner, she shows that she cares for her students and makes your transition to college such a breeze. I was pleasantly surprised that there wasn't a heavy workload, just weekly quizzes and discussion posts. I would recommend setting timers so that you don't lose out on easy points–discussion post Thursday, response to a peer by Saturday, and an open–note mini quiz by Sunday. The majority of the exams (3 total, non–cumulative) are based on the content of the slides presented during the lectures, but they do require a little bit of reading from the textbook. I appreciate Professor Gardner and the TA's organization. Everything you need to succeed, like the slides and textbook study guide for exams will be posted on Canvas."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Course was mainly lecture, but as long as you attended and listened, everything else was pretty simple"
,,,,,,,,,,,"In terms of topics, I was most interested in learning and personality. I found that personality was taught pretty well in this course and it helped me to clarify my interest in learning more about it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVED this course and would 100% take it again with Prof. Gardener. It's a pretty straightforward lecture class, but Prof. Gardener made it so interesting and engaging. She explains the concepts in simple terms and uses real examples to contextualize when she can, which I found SO helpful in understanding and remembering concepts for the tests. She's also very enthusiastic and will not hesitate to further explanations during office hours, so if you're ever confused, going to Prof. Gardener at any of the office hour times is also an amazing resource. As for the workload, it is very very light. Each week you just have to complete a short discussion board post, reply to a classmate, and complete a mini–quiz on Canvas. It's not difficult at all. There are three tests throughout the course, all same structure 5–60 MCQs. The only significant time I spent on this class was studying for tests (which included going to office hours) because you do have to pay attention in lecture and really understand the concepts to be able to feel confident on the exams. If you're even remotely interested in Psych or need to fill a distro– take this class!! You will not regret it"
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was as expected, if anything I learned a lot more in the short quarter than I expected"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course content is easy to understand. Online quizzes are a bit confusing at times, but it was easy to do well in the class. Powerpoints were a bit disorganized as well. Gardner was quite engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot, and it was a perfect introductory experience. Ideal 110 course, and the professor and TAs are amazing."
wnbg,psych,110,winter,Renee Engeln,5.67,5.32,5.32,4.73,5.66,6.56,the inquizitives were fun but not an easy A class. renee’s tests are def challenging; a weed out course for psych
,,,,,,,,,,,I thought it did a great job of teaching about so many different aspects of psych in such a short amount of time.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was great, but you have to enjoy taking multiple choice tests. Besides that, there aren't opportunities to get better grades. There is a lot of extra credit though which enormously helps your grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very good background in the basics of psychology. The concepts are interesting, and can be easily applied to real–life."
,,,,,,,,,,,Renee is amazing! She is a very engaging lecturer and truly cares about your learning. There are study guides for each exam so just know them well and you're gonna ace this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,The work can definitely sneak up on you as there isn't homework due weekly but a set due before each exam. Renee makes the lectures so interesting and it's definitely important to go to each class.
,,,,,,,,,,,I really learned so much in this class and I learned a lot about myself aswell. I genuinly think I learned more in this single course than I have learned in any class ever. I think the course material can appeal to anyone.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was very challenging because I have no psychology background. There is a lot of memorization, and it would be best to go to office hours before you dig yourself in a hole. Take advantage of ALL extra credit opportunities. Renee is an amazing lecturer however, her exams are EXTREMELY difficult. They are scenario based and require a lot of application. I did not pass any exam..."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is very fun and easy
,,,,,,,,,,,"Favorite class taken at Northwestern so far!! Going to Professor Renee's classes every Monday and Wednesday was something I really looked forward to –– her lectures are informative, fun, and engaging. You can tell that she really cares about her students and has a true love for psychology. The tests are challenging, but nothing you can't handle if you answer the review questions beforehand and actually do the readings and Inquizitives. She also has so many opportunities for extra credit, whether it be papers or in–class opportunities. Take this class with Renee!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was very interesting. Professor Renee taught this course in a manner that was quite captivating to any person that happened to stumble across psychology or wasn't very interested in the course initially. There were times when I was in the class I completely forgot that the class was simply a requirement for me. HOWEVER, the grading part of the class was quite stressful and nerve–wracking. The class is completely test based. If you are not a good test taker, you are doomed to fail as the tests make up a significant part of your final grade and whether or not you will pass. While it sounds as easy as studying and taking the test, the class threw me for a curve ball as many of the test answers seem similar and it is more difficult than one would imagine. Do take this class if you are truly interest, but if you do not have the several hours to dedicate to answering dozens of review questions, going to office hours frequently to discuss those review questions, and doing hours of online questions to properly prepare for the course, I would not recommend taking the class just yet. I cannot even confirm if I passed the class from the last midterm despite completing weeks of preparation."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor is absolutely amazing – her classes are extremely engaging! Any professor that can make the whole tech auditorium crack up during an afternoon lecture is absolutely awesome. Really organized lectures. Very readable and engaging textbook. Very reasonable exams (she even throws out questions that too many people get wrong). Absolutely recommend!
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's probably easy if you study, I took it pass fail as a McCormick theme class so I didn't study and I'm barely passing (but passing nonetheless)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class will teach you a lot, but also drain your time, especially during the weekends before midterms (at least for me). I would basically spend the entire week before a midterm doing all my work due before the midterm, and then study for three or so days straight to memorize the content. I feel like this wasn't the best strategy, and to add on, I'm a very stem focused person so reading and memorization isn't my strong suit. However, even spending 3–5 days studying, and dedication the 2–3 days before the midterm solely to studying for it, I did badly. If you're weinberg, you'll probably be fine, but if you're not required to take this class and you're not that interested in it or don't have a lot of free time (most people), probably think twice about taking it."
,,,,,,,,,,,Renee is awesome. Makes lecture interesting and engaging with jokes and super clear slides/lecture style. I learned a lot and she makes it obvious that she wants you to succeed. There are 3 exams across the quarter and she gives you a set of around 70 questions for each that are the exact ideas you will be asked about on the exams. If you put in just a little preparation you should be able to do well. Also there are many extra credit opportunities that are awesome.
,,,,,,,,,,,"To me this course was basically a game of how well you can memorize. Although it was interesting, the exams are just multiple choice so you must memorize definitions and such. It is very helpful to do the reading and not get behind on Inquizitives."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is great. The content is interesting and the midterms are not too hard if you keep up with the readings and homework and pay attention in lecture. Renee is amazing and makes the class enjoyable and interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved her teaching and lecture style. She was super fun and always made jokes. She shared experiences from her own life to really cement certain concepts too! Awesome teacher and lecturer. Her review questions also made studying for tests very simple and straight forward, however you did have to spend some time answering them."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course provided me with a great introductory insight into psychology in a very accessible manner. I think it's a great course for anyone to take if they're interesting in learning more about this field.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very easy class, recommend taking as a distro. There are 3 noncumulative midterms that are all multiple choice and very easy as long as you do the hws and the review questions she posts. The lectures are very casual which can sometimes make it seem that the examples are unimportant but if she mentions it in class there is a high chance it will show up on the exam, so make note of all her examples and videos she shows. Lots of opportunities for extra credit. If you put in even a little bit of effort you will get an A."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Renee is a wonderful professor. Every lecture felt like I was watching a TEDtalk because she was such a good lecturer. You can really tell Renee loves psychology and loves teaching, which just made me love the class that much more. Granted, I did find out that I don't want to major in psychology, but the class was enjoyable and rewarding nevertheless. I would also say go to office hours because Renee is really enthusiastic about meeting students, and she will also help with the review questions if you don't know or couldn't find the answers to them."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It may have just been me, but the class felt very difficult. The content was interesting and I enjoyed learning about it, but the tests felt difficult. The number one tip is to do the extra credit, every time."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class. Renee was a fantastic speaker, felt like I had a ted talk every time I came to class. She was engaging and communicated what we needed to know for the exams very well. I enjoyed taking it, as long as you pay attention in class and do her lecture + book questions before exams you'll do great."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVED this course. It was so simple to get a good grade in this class. I wouldn't say it was easy, I definitely had to study and put the time in for readings, but the information was interesting so I really didn't mind! Also, the layout of the class was ridiculously clear, which is something that matters to me a lot. The extra credit opportunities were great, as were the lectures. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class to anyone interested in psychology or anyone is looking to fulfill the social and behavioral sciences distro."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Renee is such a great professor, and she will definitely pique your interest in psychology! The course does require effort and a decent amount of studying before exams, but it will be very clear what you need to study to do well. Highly recommend this class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This is an amazing Intro to Psych class. Prof. Engeln is an incredibly engaging lecturer and the exams aren't too bad if you keep up with the reading. This is a great distro I genuinely enjoyed and got me way more interested in psychology.
,,,,,,,,,,,Was so good. Rennee is my favorite person ever
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is honestly such a fun class, 100% recommend. It's pretty easy as long as you do the reading and review sheets, and Renee is honestly a wonderful professor. You'll learn a lot too, and because it's so big you'll definitely be taking it with friends so that's even better."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a very good class! The lectures were very informative and interactive. Renee is a really great professor. There is not too much work for this class and a lot of extra credit points are offered. Tests can be a little tricky, but they are find if you study for them!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall this class is twice a week with chapter reading and homework modules that are not due until the end of the quarter. Additionally there are multiple extra credit opportunities. The only ""difficult"" aspect are the lab study credits you have to sign–up for, but they are made very easily accessible."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class was engaging, and I learned a lot. Even with such a large class, there was still help available if you needed it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not an easy A by any means, but still an interesting class for a distro."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was impressed by how engaging the lectures were, but also by how difficult the exams were for me"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Amazing class! It was very interesting to learn about so many different aspects of psychology and Renee did an amazing job of keeping the class fun and engaging. The content was very interesting and the three midterms were not difficult, though some studying outside of class is definitely necessary. Lots of extra credit opportunities were offered as well which definitely helped out a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,"So many textbook readings – very time–consuming but Professor Engeln's lectures made this class very interesting. She also gives out a TON of extra credit (both in–class & outside – you get 3 EC short papers). The exams are fair if you go to class/watch lecture recordings and read the textbook, just manage your time wisely."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is one of the best I've taken here – Engeln is an excellent professor who cares deeply about her students. The course material is interesting and broadly applicable to a wide variety of fields. I would recommend that everyone take this class if they can fit it into their schedule, whether it's a requirement or not. Engeln is very charismatic and has great stage presence – I could feel her enthusiasm teaching this course all the way from the balcony of the auditorium. This, combined with her vast understanding of psychology, makes her one of the best professors that I've had the pleasure of being taught by."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is easy but time–consuming. The class itself teaches you how to study for it but it's mostly memorization of facts and concepts. If you follow Dr Engeln's advice you will get an A. Just be prepared to put time into it.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class and thought it was very easy to succeed in. I honestly just did the readings enough to answer the review questions, and the only was I studied for exams was by answering and studying those review questions (that's all you need to know for the test, so it's not ambiguous as to what will be on the exam). I highly recommend trying to get Prof Engeln if you can. She is an amazing lecturer and going to lecture felt like listening to a TED talk – she made the material very engaging and interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Workload is manageable (just readings with practice problems that you can keep trying until you get a 100%) and the class covers a bunch of interesting content. I found that that I actually enjoyed reading the textbook (which is almost never the case), because it was easily digestable and touched on interesting experiments for each concept. The lectures were pretty engaging too. There are 3 noncumulitive MC exams. All the questions are fair, but they will make explicit references to specific studies or names from the book and the lectures (so without reading/ attending lectures, you probable wouldn't do terrific, even if you understand the concepts well)"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was not a ton of work, just quite a bit of reading. The tests were very challenging but consistent with the review questions we were given."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Renee is a great professor, she's super enthusiastic during lectures. Sometimes it's easy to get lost in her lectures like you start to not really know what's going on anymore because of all the tangents that she goes on, but they're still super fun and engaging. The content is pretty cool and applicable to real life and the tests are not bad at all. All the questions are pretty much straight from the textbook or from class. Quizlets for this class also help a ton!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Renee was a wonderful instructor. I loved the good vibes that she brought. That being said, I think her exams are VERY brutal in comparison to other Psych 110 classes. They were very heavy and EXTREMELY applicable. I didn't do good in this course and im kinda sad bc psych 110 should be an easy class, but her tests were very hard."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class! very interesting and prof is very engaging
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Engeln is amazing this class is great
,,,,,,,,,,,Overall. Its alright. Tests were harder than expected.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think Professor Renee was great at teaching this course. The things we learned in lecture were very interesting and engaging. I will say that the textbook readings were a lot and very boring. The exams we had were very difficult because I would know the material but the question would be asking about a very tiny detail. The wording of the exams were very tricky, but there are a lot of extra credit opportunities throughout the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Renee is an amazing professor and such an engaging lecturer. If you have a choice TAKE PSYCH WITH RENEE. She is so extremely personable and keeps you engaged for the full 1 1/2–hour lectures. The exams can be difficult, but if you keep up with the readings and review questions, which are extremely reasonable, it is easy to well in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a really great course–– it was very well laid out & organized and Prof. Engeln is an amazing lecturer. It does require some work every week to go through the review questions posted from the lecture & the textbook, but if you put in the work it is a completely do–able class. Prof. Engeln is so engaging, every class felt like an interesting talk you wanted to be at rather than a lecture that was a chore. She is so kind and gives you lots of extra credit points. Highly recommend this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Okay class, but it has lots of content so you kinda have to memorize lots of stuff. Renee is an amazing professor. She gives lots of extra credit opportunities which boost your grade since your grade is solely determined by the three ""midterms"". No final. There's a lab requirement and some of the studies are interesting, but others are just questionnaires which makes them very boring. Additionally, I think these studies should be entirely optional (if you don't complete them you get an Incomplete)"
,,,,,,,,,,,pretty easy class as long as you take notes on lectures and fill out the study guide questions using the book. GO TO OFFICE HOURS BEFORE THE EXAM i promise you wont regret it wink wink.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Engeln is by far one of my favorite profs that I've ever hard –– she is truly passionate about the topic and thoroughly engaging with the class. Usually I have a hard time with 80 minute classes, but I never felt tired during the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,It's a kinda easy class if you have someone to study with. I could not do the readings because I had no time so I just command f the answers to the study guides on the textbook.
,,,,,,,,,,,Very interesting lectures. Renee is great.
,,,,,,,,,,,You do have to participate in some psych studies though and some are in person.
,,,,,,,,,,,Make sure to go to lecture because some times Renee gives little extra credit activities after lecture.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Psych 110 is not a hard course at all, especially if you just go to lecture and study sufficiently before each exam, it is an easy A."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I love the professor, Renee. Her positivity and energy really enhance this class experience. I took this class as an MCAT prep course, and it definitely addressed all the right things for the test. Also, I ended up actually enjoying the content more than I thought I would (I had no previous psych experience)."
,,,,,,,,,,,I enjoyed this class! I think the introductory topics peaked my interest in psychology and the impacts of different social or individual behaviors. The classes were very engaging and I think what was expected of our class was very reasonable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this course and learned a lot about psychology. Professor Engeln is an amiable and enthusiastic instructor who kept lectures interesting and showed genuine care for students' well–being. As it is a lot of information to learn in 10 weeks, the courseload could be heavy with around 2 chapters per week, but it was manageable and it wasn't too hard to catch up if you fell behind. The tests are fairly difficult but not cumulative; performance is pretty much based on memorization skills and how well you understand the material."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Renee is super funny and cares a lot about her students. Tests were definitely challenging, but helped you learn while you were taking them. InQuisitive is vert annoying to do, though."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Tests are not cumulative and there are only three of them, the homework is super helpful for learning new topics and the review questions are excellent for test preparation."
,,,,,,,,,,,Love this course! Lectures and textbook were really interesting and I actually really liked the 3 exams worth the same points instead of the midterm–final thing.
,,,,,,,,,,,"As a psychology major, this class was so incredible. Renee is super engaging, and while there's a lot covered in the class, it's no impossible to keep up. The exams are a little challenging, but the extra credit opportunities and the Inquizitive homeworks definitely help. Would absolutely recommend this class, but would not say it's just an easy distro."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was okay. The lectures were boring, the homework was relatively easy and you learned from it, but you really need to study for the exams. DO THE IN CLASS EXTRA CREDIT"
,,,,,,,,,,,The lectures were captivating so I always went even though they were recorded and the topics were interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,I thought the lectures were particularly interesting as Professor Engeln made an effort to connect with the class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course had more tasks than I thought it would, but it was overall manageable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"EXAMS ARE BRUTAL. Renee is amazing and classes are genuinely interesting and fun, but you need to spend a lot of time studying for the exams. I wouldn't recommend it just as a distro though its rough and not an easy A"
,,,,,,,,,,,The lectures were great but there is a lot of reading. The tests are somewhat difficult but there are a lot of extra credit opportunities.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think this class is very interesting and definitely better than my AP Psych class. I did not like my AP class, but this class was interesting. Renee is a good lecturer and I think she makes the examples pretty clear and is very engaging. Although I did not think this was incredibly easy, I did do a lot of work for the tests. There is extra credit opportunities which is good and the homework are easy 100s. I know many CTECs say everyone fails the first exam, but our average was literally an 85 for the first one. Don't do what I did and leave everything till lat minute. I don't think this class is that terrible, it is an easy bistro to get a decent grade, but no easy A."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked the inquizitive homeworks a lot because they were a fun and interactive way to learn the material. In addition, everything was really interesting and it was a good introduction into the field of psychology."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVED THIS COURSE! Prof. Engeln is by far the best professor that I have had so far. She is so good at making a 1 hr 20 min lecture feel short and engaging. The material she teaches is super interesting and relates to a lot of aspects of real–life. The exams can be a bit difficult and the course material can be very heavy, but I certainly learned a great deal in this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was literally my favorite class at Northwestern so far. I came into this class with some interest in psychology and this class just confirmed that psychology is something I definitely want to continue to pursue. Professor Engeln is an amazing professor and definitely would recommend taking the class with her. Some of the concepts are difficult to understand but she always does a great job making sure we understand it. Like I feel like I know so much about her because she would always tell us stories that help us understand a psych concept we're learning that day in class. She also shows a lot of videos in class which also keeps the class very engaging. Time really flew during class. For me, while I did very well in the class. I would not necessarily say it is an easy A. I definitely had to work hard to prepare for the exams, but Professor Engeln did a great job preparing us. She provides us with a set of review problems before each exam and doing the review problems was the best way to study. Knowing the content from the review problems and remembering videos we watched in class would guarantee you scored well on the exam. And if you don't do great on an exam,Professor Engeln provided us with sooooo many extra credit opportunities. We could write 2 optional papers (for up to 6 points) and they were many smaller in–class extra credit opportunities. Overall, I highly recommend you take the class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Awesome! Renee Engeln is a beast. Lectures were very engaging, lots of opportunities for extra credit if you slip up on an exam like I did. Review questions were ridiculously helpful."
,,,,,,,,,,,it is not as easy as the other ctects say. it is very interesting though.
,,,,,,,,,,,"RENEE IS INCREDIBLE! She makes 1 h 20 min lectures feel so short, she disperses videos and different anecdotes throughout each lecture so that you are still engaged but you also learn the material better. The homework isn't much work besides the 3 exams which you have to study a lot for. Definitely a more intense class if you're just taking it for a distro but I learned so much and it was really interesting. Also so so much extra credit opportunities."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great class to take, especially if you're interested in psych but not sure what specific areas. Renee is the BEST and makes lectures very engaging. The readings can be long but are not that hard to get through."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Renee is a great and engaging teacher. TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HER!!! The homework is do–able and honestly usually fun. The exams are challenging, but she offers a lot of extra credit and explains how to study. Very, very interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Course overall was pretty good, but the labs are probably the worst things in the world, where you're guinea pigs for grad students. If you're not a psychology major I do not recommend, not worth the time and effort needed for the credit."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is super interesting. It is not too difficult but does involve a decent amount of work and you do need to study for the exams
,,,,,,,,,,,Probably one of the best professors that I have taken a course with. She is one of the best lecturers and I felt that I was able to understand the content really well and actually look forward to going to class. The exams are definitely difficult and there are weekly inquisitive/readings but they're more lenient. I really enjoyed the overall content from this class and felt that I learned a lot.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures are very interesting and help keep you focused during class. However, a good portion of the exams focused on material not covered in class and it was sometimes difficult to predict what information from the lectures would be on the exams. Overall, pretty interesting course though the tests did have a level of difficulty to them."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class with Renee! She is an amazing lecturer! Her positivity and relatability make each class engaging and feel almost like a Ted talk. There are three exams (not cumulative) which are ~65 multiple choice questions that are very fair. As long as you know how to answer the review questions that she posts before each test, you will be fine. There are also multiple extra–credit opportunities. Overall, I loved this course and have nothing bad to say about it. I learned a lot and also got a good grade. Great distro!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Engeln was the best lecturer I have had at this school. Some of the classes could have been shortened but I really enjoyed the longer class periods and the explanations that were provided for everything. This was a really fun and interesting class that was a great introduction to psychology.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Psych 110 with Renee is a good class to take as a distro or just out of curiosity. She is a good lecturer, there's a lot of extra credit, and as long as you take notes and pay attention it's not too much work."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Renee is by far the best lecturer I have had – she's amazing. You definitely have to take good notes and study before the exams because they will be hard. Lots of extra credit opportunities throughout the quarter which really helps the grade. I wouldn't say it's an easy A, but it's definitely achievable."
,,,,,,,,,,,It was good.
,,,,,,,,,,,Renee is so fun to learn from and actually knows how to keep students awake during lecture.
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is great and not daunting at all for a huge intro class. Renee is the best lecturer I've had at Northwestern. She is super funny and great at explaining material in a way that makes me remember it better just by listening. The homework is designed so that you can always get 100 and I think the tests were extremely fair and she has great review material. I took this class as a distro and also because I was curious about psych and I want to take more classes now. Great class!
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROF ENGELN! She is wonderful, such an engaging lecturer! Generally these hour and 20 min classes are very hard to get through and feel incredibly long, but it was painless attending these lectures. All the lectures are recorded, so attendance in–person isn't mandatory. At least watch the lectures, because many of the examples she gives in class are referenced on the exams. She posts reading questions after every lecture which outline what will be on each midterm (3 non–cumulative midterms total, no final). As long as you understand the reading questions you will do well on the exams, but there are a lot to get through so keep that in mind. Engeln also gives a lot of extra credit opportunities, and usually gives everyone an extra 2 or 3 points on each exam."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty interesting class, easy tests, skippable lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this class. Renee’s lecture were super interesting and engaging and I learned a lot. Not super difficult or time consuming either—a great distro.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The content of this course is way too much to maintain for practically biweekly exams. There was just too much content and not enough time to process it. Also, although Professor Engeln was good an explaining the content, he exams were unnecessarily difficult and hyper–specific. Some questions to refer to words or phrases she would say in lecture that are super easy to forget. I feel as though there was a lot of trick questions on the exam, designed so you get the question wrong."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Engeln is probably one of the best professors at Northwestern. She made every lecture interesting by applying a lot of concepts to her own life – something that most professors don't do. There are 3 exams, but Renee gives you all of the questions that you should be quizzing yourself on before. Make sure you take notes and do the review questions because that is the main way to study for this class. Form a study group – it will make studying for this class way more fun. I'd recommend this class to anyone who is looking for a distro or is just interested in psych."
,,,,,,,,,,,Renee is a great instructor. She is super engaging and kind. I wish there were more opportunities to raise your grade outside of the exam. The multiple choice is hard and not straight forward. You have to know the material inside and out. Do the extra credit essays
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Engeln is great. Her lectures are very engaging. The class is quite fast paced but interesting. There is a bit of reading to do for each class, but it's doable. Try not to fall behind. Exams were very fair and people generally did well on them. I studied a decent bit and did well on exams. Extra credit is offered. I recommend this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is amazing, Renee is the best professor, offers so many extra credit opportunities. That said, it's not an easy A, with three non–cumulative exams you can do a max of 3 extra credit papers worth 3 pts each (can only get 6 pts total though) plus a lot of in class extra credit too. The exams are fair but bulky, and I would def recommend studying early in advance and going to lectures. Easy A–, a bit more effort for an A."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was one of the greatest. Easy to come in if you have no prior knowledge of psychology, this course is a great introduction to psychological methods, and some basic theories on behavior, personality, etc. You don't deep dive into the fascinating ""i hate my dad because of __"" but more of basic as to what part of the brain is responsible for what and how that affects us."
,,,,,,,,,,,Intro psych is definitely an over view and doesn’t go into a whole lot of detail of each area. Professor is very enthusiastic about teaching and is engaging in during lecture. Tests are very heavy on memorization and covers material from lecture and the textbook. Inquisitives are part of your final grade and are very tedious to complete
,,,,,,,,,,,"3 non–cumulative exams. There's a lot of content, but Engeln tells you exactly what you need to know, so the tests aren't bad if you study (but you do have to study). Engeln is a great lecturer so class was engaging the whole time! Readings from the textbook are important but they're interesting so it's not a big deal."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Interesting, didn't take AP psych but still felt ok"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Interesting intro class, cover a range of topics, exams are multiple choice (3 total, all noncumulative)."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Engeln ate this class up. Never been so excited to go to a class. She made the walk from south to tech totally worth it.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course, especially the positive atmosphere brought to class and the focus on aspects of psychology we knew already, but focused around real world examples"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was effective in allowing me to learn, but textbook readings were long and had to be done for the midterms. The midterms were interesting, for they were 65 multiple choice questions, a format I had never really experienced before and somewhat challenged me unexpectedly."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class even though I did not get an outstanding grade. Professor Engeln is a great teacher who is very engaging and fun. Her class feels like a Ted Talk, partially because it was in Tech Auditorium but mainly just because of the way she teaches and handles lecture. There is a lot of content to learn at one time, but the exams aren't cumulative (3 exams, no final) so it is easy to study small amounts of content. The only thing provided for review are the review questions and her lecture recordings, which personally did not help me. The exam averages weren't bad but each exam is worth nearly 30% of your grade, so you have to at least do decent to pass the class/get a good grade. The exams weren't incredibly hard but find so many different study strategies to make sure you can answer some of the weirdly worded questions. She did give points back for questions everyone missed and offered extra credit (3 optional papers worth 3 points each but you can only get 6 points; small in–class assignments worth .5–1 point but they take a few minutes and are worth it). I loved this class and would recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"At first, I felt like the lectures could be more condensed as it felt like part of the lectures were tangents that were loosely related to the material, which could've been cut out. However, as the course progressed, I found that I welcomed how laid back the courses were and found that the stories she wove into the lectures were entertaining and for the most part applicable to what we were currently learning. The professor was a joy to experience. Her positive attitude and energetic personality was contagious. The course itself is definitely doable and not one you're likely to sleep through."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Engeln is a very engaging lecturer and cares about her students! You do need to read the textbook, but she gives you review questions that tell you what concepts to look for. Make sure to dedicate time during the week to complete the reading and Inquizitives, and use the review questions to study for exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very solid intro psych course; Renee is a very engaging lecturer, which makes class feel like it goes by pretty quick. She is very nice and really helps you understand and remember the material. There are 3 non–cumulative midterms that are all multiple choice. They focus on applying the material, so you definitely need to understand the concepts and have knowledge of real life examples. Lots of extra credit opportunities, too. Overall really liked the class. She also recorded the lectures but its more fun to go in person."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was AMAZING and Renee is the best professor and her office hours are so fun. The only thing I would say is if you're not interested in psych whatsoever and are doing this just for a distro this is not the class for you because to really learn and do well on the tests it's a ton of work. But even if you're just considering psych as an option you should totally take this class!
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought the exams were adequately challenging, but not too difficult if you prepare well. Also, there are a bunch of opportunities for extra credit."
,,,,,,,,,,,Amazing professor that makes learning as engaging as possible
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS FOR DISTRO! I genuinely loved this class and learned a lot for such a hefty topic that generally cannot be covered in one quarter. Renee is an incredible lecturer and as someone who struggles to get through 1.5 hr lectures, I can say that she was super engaging. Her passion really shines through and her many years in the field allow her to share experiences and anecdotes that other professors in intro psych courses at other colleges are not as likely to have (watch her ted talk and you'll see). The evaluation format is three non–cumulative midterms that are 65 questions each. They are often curved and are solely based on review questions that are provided. Watch/attend lectures and do the review questions and the midterms are basically light work. If you do not do the necessary reading then some of the test questions can be a bit difficult as I've come to realize (I tested both routes between the first and second midterm which allows me some perspective here)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS!! Favorite class so far and Renee is a fabulous professor. Genuinely sad this class is over. Lectures were amazing: truly looked forward to them and found them to be one of the best parts of my week. While this class is challenging intellectually, it is a rewarding course and I didn't mind the work. Once you get into the routine of keeping up with the reading and questions, the class flows smoothly. My best advice is to keep up with review questions, readings and lectures and you certainly will be fine. (I also would say, not all of the reading is necessary: focus on the review questions she gives that say everything that will be on the test) In summary, best class ever: Renee is fabulous. If you are looking for a way to get into psychology (like I was) or just looking for something fun to study, I 100 percent recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course can be extremely easy or difficult depending on your strengths and weaknesses. Although it isn't too difficult, it should not be overlooked, as the exams can creep up on you with 65 MC questions. The curriculum and exams are centered around memorization, which can make studying a bit monotonous. However, I would strongly recommend taking it as someone who's interested in Psychology. Furthermore, the material provides substantial insight and really opened my eyes to things I took for granted, such as proper study skills, memory, and how the brain works."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Engeln made this class so engaging and interesting, I loved every lecture and learned more than I have in any of my other classes"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Amazing course, I really enjoyed Professor Renee, and she made this course so enjoyable and interesting. There can be a lot of reading, but if you do the readings, then you're almost guaranteed to pass. Highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a really great class. The topics were interesting and I thought the lectures were fun and engaging. Prof. Engeln explained topics in ways that made them really easy to understand, and the review questions for the exams were super helpful."
,,,,,,,,,,,The class was very well structured and engaging
,,,,,,,,,,,Renee is an incredible teacher who gives you the tools to succeed in the class and anecdotes that will forever solidify concepts in the class.
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof Engeln is fun and you can learn a lot if you put in the time
,,,,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed this class. It did require some work however the reading could be skimmed. The in person class was so interesting and engaging and I really felt like I could relate what I was learning to my daily life.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a lot more challenging than I thought going in. The tests are the main part of your grade, so you really need to put in the effort to study to make sure you have a strong understanding go the concepts. I also found it challenging as someone that is not the greatest test taker, so if that is you, I would recommend maybe a different class. But the concepts are interesting, there is a lot of extra credit opportunities and the lectures are fun."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As someone interested in psychology but having never taken a formal class on it, this course was a pretty good introduction to the subject. I expected the content to focus on the ""famous"" aspects of psychology everyone has heard about like Freud and Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs etc., but surprisingly we only covered those briefly. Instead we covered a wide range of topics from the psychology of learning to social psychology to psychopathology, which I appreciated. Professor Engeln is a fun and engaging lecturer and I tried my best to attend her lectures because I enjoyed hearing her opinions on different psychology issues. There's 3 exams that are all weighted equally and not cumulative (which was very nice), and were all multiple choice, so mostly relied on memorizing and applying what you learned in class and read in the textbook. Although Professor Engeln said you don't have to take notes on the textbook reading, I still ended up doing so because the exams tested us on specific things only mentioned in the book. Thus I spent a significant amount of time outside of class taking textbook notes and doing homework assignments (we used Inquizitive modules) that were a bit tedious but ultimately helped me study for the test. Overall, if you've ever learned psychology before, this is a great intro class and the professor is pretty fun, but for those who already have basic knowledge, it's going to be rather repetitive and not worthwhile. I wish there were more collaborative or written assignments that allowed us to reflect on the interesting topics we learned, because most of the time we were just memorizing things."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Renee Engeln is the best professor ever. She is super engaging and kind. She really cares about students. This class is an easy A if you study. Renee publishes review questions after each lecture, and each topic will have an associated question on the exam. Answer the questions, study them, and you can easily end with over 100% in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There are three exams and no final, and you have to do some textbook readings and answer questions along the way. Overall, minimal work, and an interesting distribution."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course covered topics that were consistently interesting, memorable, and sometimes even applicable to everyday life! Renee is an AMAZING lecturer, you HAVE TO TAKE THIS WITH HER!!!!! She's just so chill, fun, and an amazing person, as well as explaining everything in a way that begs you to understand, wonder, reflect, and remember them! Her office hours were popular to just have people ask her random questions. Pretty much, the way the class worked is – you have to do a textbook chapter of reading (which was quite a bit) before each class, and a quiz program online (on which you're guaranteed 100 every time if you spend enough time on it). Tests are 65 multiple choice questions covering topics from a group of review questions she hands out after each class and textbook reading. If you have the time to read/are a fast reader and aren't against memorizing some material, this class is a must take."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is similar to AP Psych, where it gives you a brief introduction to all the different types of psych. The professor is a great lecturer and is really funny. The homework is kind of annoying. It's an online interactive textbook and you have to answer questions until you get to a certain number of points. At first, it'll take you a while when you're getting used to the betting system of points (you'll see what I mean). But afterward, it'll be fine. You also have to be constantly studying. The professor posts the review questions of what she thinks is important after every lecture and for each chapter of the textbook. If you wait until the last minute to do them before the exam, you will barely have enough time to complete them. There's probably a total of 70–100 questions for each exam."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Engeln is a wonderful lecturer and amazing professor. The exams are tough, but she offers a lot of extra credit."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It covered a wide variety of content, so I did learn a lot"
,,,,,,,,,,,"MUST TAKE THIS COURSE!! And take it with Renee. I loved this class, loved attending lectures, and if you do the review questions and memorize those answers you’ll easily get an A in this class. I’m recommending it to all of my friends!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,It was pretty hard but good for learning.
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Engeln was an amazing lecturer and I was highly engaged every time I attended the class. The tests can be pretty challenging but the extra credit papers and points given out in class help your grade a lot. I recommend taking this class and learning a lot about the foundations of psychology!
,,,,,,,,,,,class and homeworks are easy. Exams are hard asf
,,,,,,,,,,,Renee is AMAZING
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class so much!!!!! I highly recommend taking it. It is so valuable to learn about people, and this class is a great way to start doing that. I now am double–majoring in psychology, which I decided to do halfway through this class! The work is minimal, and the three tests are multiple choice and non–cumulative."
,,,,,,,,,,,"love this course! professor engelgn is super nice and engaging. i liked the lectured. exams are multiple choice and i found them to be fine. i didn't always feel great after the exam because i did end up being unsure on quite a few but it ended up being fine. so many opportunities for extra credit that help cushion your grade. the readings did take a decent amount of time (like an hour or two) for each one – i wouldn't actually read the whole chapter just look for the answers for the review questions she gives you. doing the inquisitive quizzes on the readings were annoying but doable. for the first exam i studied for a couple days. i recommend doing the review questions for the lectures and reviews gradually and then you really only need to study for like a day to do pretty good. even if you aren't going to do psych i would take this class, super interesting and engaging. in my opinion its an easy a."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this course with Prof. Engeln! She is an amazing lecturer and fun person who will keep you engaged with relevant examples from her own life, other psychology experiments, etc. I had the longest days ever on Mondays and Wednesdays with all four classes, and Psych 110 was my final one of the day. I would never feel like walking up to Tech to go in person, but every time I was glad that I did. I read previous CTECs that said the exams are difficult or nitpicky but I found that they were fair. Just pay attention during lecture and write down examples she uses. Do the review questions. There are a lot of them, but also it's nice because you know 100% what topics are going to be on the exam. Overall great class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Renee Engeln is an amazing professor!!! She's so cool, fun to talk to, and willing to help you. Go to her office hours and ask questions that you have (don't be lazy and go!). You really just need to do the review questions and make a quizlet based on that to study. She gives plenty of opportunities for EC as well. The material is really interesting, and while the lectures are 1.5 hours, it flies by because what you're learning is really interesting and Renee makes it fun! The only thing I would say is that there is a lot of reading and the little Inquizitives can take forever. Great choice for a distro though!"
,,,,,,,,,,,The lectures were extremely engaging I really enjoyed them. Exams were extremely memorization heavy though
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was really interesting and easy to do well if you watch the lectures and completed the extra credit. I found the review questions helpful in preparing for the exams, but the book was not really that helpful besides looking up material for the questions. The exams are difficult, especially because the questions are extremely subjective and easily misconstrued, but the extra credit makes up for it. The professor is great; she is so easy to listen to and easy to understand."
wnbg,psych,110,spring,Sara Broaders,5.01,4.75,5.05,4.51,4.92,6.35,"Very interesting class, not too much work and not super stressful."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I suggest avoiding taking PSYCH 110 with Broaders. She is a good lecturer and provides extra credit for showing up to class, but I know other professors are more lenient than her, especially for PSYCH 110. The class has three midterms and an optional cumulative final. The midterms are extremely difficult and super specific, ranging from questions about what she said in lecture one time to a really small detail in the book."
,,,,,,,,,,,The course gave an overview of many very interesting parts of psychology and supplemented all the claims with empirical data.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Broaders is a phenomenal professor, I just don't believe her course was for me. She has plenty of opportunities for you to get extra credit and raise your grade, which is needed because the midterms can be quite difficult. I think her teaching style was phenomenal and super approachable. She can be a bit abrasive at times but besides that she was great. It is imperative to go to class and do the readings prior to class because she moves VERY fast once lecture has begun."
,,,,,,,,,,,"pure memorization, lots of extra credit, should be an easy A"
,,,,,,,,,,,This was the first class at NU that I actually enjoyed.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think this course was a very good distro requirement. It was not much work, and the work that is there wasn't that hard at all. I highly recommend everyone take this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely a fairly easy class, but there is a lot of reading. It is a pretty easy A if you put in like 2–3 hours reviewing before the test. I'd say if you're looking at this class for a distro, this should be one of your lower options for an easy A. There is a lot of content for an intro class and the readings are pretty long."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Broaders does a very good job of structuring lectures in a way that is both engaging and informative. In class we use the topics that we are learning about in demonstrations or examples such as sensory tests, memory tests, and shaping our classmates behavior. The lectures are fast–paced but very interesting and help students form a deep understanding of the material with memorable examples."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked the lectures, but I oftentimes felt overwhelmed before studying for the exams because there was so much material that wasn't totally interrelated."
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof. Broaders is great
,,,,,,,,,,,I felt like this course had a lot of unnecessary components. I thought the research requirements were unnecessary and took up way too much time. The canvas quizzes were also unnecessary. The lectures were very boring and long.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was extremely effective at teaching the intro to psych material. The textbook was really good, and there were plenty of assessments available to you before the exams to ensure that you were keeping up with the material."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Broaders is a very good teacher and knows a lot about the subject. The class is definitely very fast paced and make sure to attend every single class as missing one class will set you behind a lot and there is a LOT of extra credit given. However, you still have to work harder to get an A with Professor Broaders as the midterms and final are longer than what the other professors have from what I have heard. Make sure to read the textbook!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is a lot for an intro course. It is very interesting, and you cover a very broad range of psychology topics, and in that sense is an amazing intro to psych. The textbook readings are pretty time consuming, but they do help consolidate the content and the inquisitives are pretty helpful for learning"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great course! I learned so much, and Prof Broaders is a very effective lecturer. She makes the information interesting with videos and demonstrations in class. As long as you take the time to study and do the readings, you will do fine on the tests. There's also extra credit available during lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Broaders is an excellent and engaging lecturer, and she definitely makes it worth coming to lecture (especially with frequent extra credit!). However, her exams definitely take dedicated studying and this probably isn't the easiest psych 110 you could take."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I did not enjoy this course. I thought the lecture slides lacked substance, and it was hard to study for exams since the lectures were not recorded to rewatch. I think the point of this was to take detailed notes during class, but it was very difficult to keep up with the professor since she spoke very fast. Also, there was always so much material we had to keep up with (extra resources, required outside readings, textbook chapters, and lecture slides) that it was difficult to cover all of this while studying for exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely very much like a high school course in terms of memorization. Lectures are interesting, but honestly the best way to do well in this course is to make sure you spend time memorizing (re–writing notes, flashcards, etc.) when studying for tests."
,,,,,,,,,,,A lot of content. A lot of studying.
,,,,,,,,,,,I wouldn't say its an easy A because you need a 94% to get an A and your grade comes primarily from midterms. That being said there is a lot of extra credit that is offered and your lowest exam grade gets dropped so it is fairly easy to get either and A– or B+
,,,,,,,,,,,Classes were actually really fun because Professor would frequently show fun videos or have students participate in class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a good class, an easy B. You need to study for the tests though."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course is super interesting. Its a basic intro to psych course, but lectures were enjoyable and although studying can take a bit of time, the course material isn't really mentally challenging and you can easily connect topics to each other making it easier to memorize"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really like the way the class is delivered. The lecture was fun, and we had a lot of opportunities to listen to TED talks, read books, and do practice tests."
,,,,,,,,,,,Much of the content is similar to AP and IB Psychology so having a background with these classes was very useful and made the class a fairly easy review. Participating in the Psychology lab studies can be really fun if you're interested in the information they're gathering even if it was a little tedious at times. Overall the course is very interesting and provides insight into how you're own brain works which is cool.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was really fun, but a lot of work. The course material was interesting and taught well by Professor Broaders. She added many personal anecdotes that helped solidify all the terms required and had good slides that were great for reviewing. There was lots of extra credit and no curve so you always know what grade you have. The exams aren't too difficult or long. The main issue with this class is the amount of work. Reading the textbook takes a long time, and the practice quizzes combined with the inquisitive assignments led to a lot of work per week. There are also a lot of terms to memorize, but Quizlet helps a ton with that so it wasn't a huge deal for me."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned so much in this course. I also found the material really interesting, and Professor Broaders is great. This course is a lot of work. There is a lot of content that you have to know for every midterm, but because it is so interesting it isn't bad at all."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was set up really well – easy–to–follow lectures, clear course page and syllabus, and wonderful instructional materials that were easy to navigate and understand."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty simple intro class, studying takes time with how much material there can be to memorize but its mostly about getting a ahead before the midterms"
,,,,,,,,,,,"While the class may involve a significant amount of memorization, its true value lies in actively engaging with the material throughout the course rather than relying on last–minute cramming. By consistently reviewing and practicing the concepts, you can gain a deeper understanding of the subjects and enhance your ability to apply the knowledge effectively."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I found this class to be completely overwhelming. So much reading, literally took hours. The professor flew thru the slides and also discouraged using computers to take notes so my hand was cramped after every class. It was impossible to do well on the exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is structured well and easy to do well in so long as you put in the time. Professor Broaders is a solid lecturer and answers questions well most of the time. If you show up to class there are plenty of opportunities for extra credit and if you enjoy people watching or reading people at all, the class can be fun."
,,,,,,,,,,,"4 exams: 1 dropped, practice quizzes and activities, You definitely do have to go to class if you have Broaders, however, she makes class really interesting and even gives you extra credit most days just for coming to class. She is pretty strict and intense, but its clear that she knows what she's doing and knows how best to help you learn. Her lectures were actually really engaging and I learned a lot. Her tests are really hard even though they're multiple choice, so it's pretty easy to make like an A– in her class, but you will really have to fight if you want an A because she is definitely trying to trick you on the exams. It's not a lot of work though and the textbook was actually pretty interesting and easy to read comparatively. She also literally gives out extra credit like its candy."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not an easy A, but definitely a fun course that is easily engaging"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Lecture is packed full of slides – be ready to take lots of notes, or follow along and memorize. Prof. Broaders is a bit of a demanding teacher in terms of homework assignments, which do not receive much credit at all relative to midterms (80%). However, her tone and way of lecturing is very engaging and makes the class fun and interesting compared to learning from a textbook. Her anecdotes, experiment videos, and participation activities are a great break from the monotony of note–taking. You will learn a lot if you keep up with the course!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course because of how passionate the professor is about helping us learn. She built the class in a way that facilitates effective learning and studying. She provides us with examples and class demonstrations that help us better understand the material. For example, she led us through a meditative exercise for 15 minutes to show us that meditation is good. She gives A LOT of extra credit and a lot of them are just to get you to go to class. The midterms are dependent on the book and the lecture, so it's important that you go to class and read the book. The practice quizzes are very helpful since we can take them for an unlimited amount of time. We also had to complete 14 credits of a study or write a research paper, which I think was a fun way to see how the field of psychology works outside of the classroom."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was unnecessarily difficult. I took this for my elective and thought it would be interesting, but it was not super enjoyable. It felt like this was a weed out class. There was way too much material covered for an introductory class, therefore all of the content felt rushed. I wouldn't take it with Prof. Broaders, but instead take it with any other teacher, as students in the fall/winter had little complaints."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Do not take this class with Broaders. She makes this course excessive and overly difficult. She expects you to sift through her lecture, the textbook, her canvas quizzes, extra recorded lectures, supplemental readings/videos to study for the exam. It is an excessive amount of information that takes way too long to go through outside of class to study for her exams. This isn't what an intro psych class should look like."
,,,,,,,,,,,NA
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty great course! There is a ton of information that you have to learn for each test but if you use the professor's materials and study hard, the course is very managable."
,,,,,,,,,,,Pretty easy A if you put in a little studying. I'm not really interested in psych but Professor Broaders made lectures really engaging.
,,,,,,,,,,,"For a 110 course, this course is a decent amount of work. However, I would definitely recommend this course overall as it is very interesting and a lot of the things you learn apply to what you might see in life. Additionally, as a pre–med student, these things are important to know and as long as you show up for lectures, a good grade is pretty much guaranteed in the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very solid course in general if you are even a little bit interested in the topic. The course is not demanding and workload is very manageable. The inquizitive system and practice quizzes give by the professor are an amazing way to study and you generally do not need to put in a lot of external effort as in a lot of other classes. In other words, the study material given by the professor is really great. The lectures are also super interesting with many real life applications and examples to the concepts we are learning. Highly recommended."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a classic intro psych class. A lot of textbook reading and a ton of material. Take notes and make flashcards and an A is easily in your grasp. There’s plenty of extra credit and the test drop policy is awesome.
,,,,,,,,,,,I honestly think that Dr. Broaders makes this class a lot tougher than it has to be. The last thing you want to do is fall behind quickly. I have been able to excel in much more advanced classes at NU but had a harder time in this class for some reason. I dislike the idea of having students memorize everything to learn (not efficient). Give it your all so that you don't regret it later on. The course consists of three midterms and an optional final.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Broaders is a fantastic lecturer and is very good at keeping students engaged during class. I found it difficult to study for exams at first because content on the test comes from the lectures, textbook, and supplemental readings. However, I found making flashcards and repeating the practice exams to be the best way to study. This course was definitely more challenging than expected, but if you study just a little every day it is very manageable. Professor Broaders also offers a lot of extra credit opportunities!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm so happy that I took this course because so much of the information pertains to daily life or my personal interests. Furthermore, each module gives a taste of different fields in psychology that is deep and thought–provoking, but not too excessive. It makes me excited to take more psychology classes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is just a memorization push for exams. The content itself is basically a review of AP psych, with a few concepts going slightly more in depth."
,,,,,,,,,,,"this was an okay course, I would recommend it but I think it would be better to take it with a different professor. Broaders skipped some stuff towards the end and didn't make the lectures that engaging. Also, she made the exams a lot harder and longer than the other psych profs did. The exams had way too many detailed questions, some had statistics from the textbook. it is a lot of material to get through so make sure to space out assignments, and also space out the lab requirements– they can be tedious but it's very easy."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was okay. Prof. Broaders' lectures were pretty interesting. There is a lot of reading though, and we read about 2 textbook chapters per week + additional readings/videos/learning materials. The extra credit assignments were helpful though, and I liked that we could drop our lowest out of the 4 exams (3 midterms + 1 final)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Course was a very good intro to psych. Textbook was not that bad, and the inquisitive tool was helpful to review material, and we also had access to a lot of practice quizzes to help review for the exam quetsions. 4 exams (including final) total, but professor will only use top 3 grades so you didn't have to go to the final. You have to pay for the textbook and inquizitive tool yourself, both of which are required for the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not too challenging, especially if you have already previously taken a psych class. Just make sure to show up to class. Some material in the presentations are not in the book and vice versa. Study both for tests."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really liked this course! Professor Broaders was a really engaging lecturer and included a lot of examples and interaction during class which made it fun. Important to note that each module had a textbook reading and inquisitive practice questions, as well as a practice quiz, so the work outside of class could be kind of hefty at times. However, exams were very fair and all multiple choice. 3 midterms and an optional final which could replace lowest score. Also plenty of extra credit opportunities! This class honestly inspired me to consider a psych minor."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There are 3 noncumulative exams with an optional final and some homework for each chapter of the textbook. The exams are all mc and aren't too difficult if you read the textbook before exams. Also, if you show up to the lecture, you get a lot of extra credit (on top of two optional extra credit assignments already)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Effective introduction to psychology class, although the material is dense. Lectures move very quickly and are interactive, but a fair amount of self–studying is needed to do well on midterms. Professor Broaders is clearly well–versed in the lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Fire distro, excellent prof, best structured course I’ve taken at NU"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot by taking this course. Attendance in lectures was necessary to do well since Professor Broaders spoke in class about material not included anywhere else. There are 4 exams total (all multiple choice) which includes the final, but only 3 exams count. The course required more memorization than I anticipated, but it was doable and many extra credit opportunities were given."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was really really interesting. We covered a huge range of topics, but despite that none of them felt rushed or under explained. The chances for extra credit and the practice quizzes offered were also very very helpful in preparation for tests."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There is a lot of reading to do, but the tests are very straightforward."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures are pretty fun and engaging. The slideshows are alright and I suggest having them pulled up on your own screen while taking noted during class cause they are gone through pretty fast. There is a lot of extra credit offered which is nice and I suggest doing them. The practice questions are okay, but the Quizzes especially take a lot of time to complete fully. Personally, the hardest part for me were the class exams. There are 3 and an optional final, and they make up 80% of your grade which is a lot. I found it hard to do well on them. They are around 80 MC questions long. A found a lot of the questions to be a bit tricky where I'd narrow it down to 2 options. I found the exams to be a bit of a time crunch but still doable. I would say study more for the exams since they make up most of your grade so it is important to do well on them."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course was extremely interesting, however I do think the depth of the information and focus on neurobiology was a bit excessive. The course crammed a lot in (more than I’ve heard the other intro psych professors do) and some of the biology related exam questions were on par with neuro 202."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is quite interesting and helps you learn a lot. The lectures are not mandatory, but lots of valuable extra credit is handed out in class. I would advise people in this class to do the extra credit essays and space out your textbook readings, as all to often it ends up being countless pages of reading a day or two before an exam. The inquizitives and practice quizzes are quite useful for good practice, as well as the problems in the chapter review of each chapter. Pay attention in class, as the majority of the exams test content from the slides."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Broaders goes way off topic for half the lecture and then has to speedily try to finish her slides, but never does and just skims over stuff that is essential knowledge. Exams aren't bad with the extra credit. Inquizitives and practice quizzes force you to learn material not covered in lecture or on exams, which is annoying."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a very good introductory course. It is not too difficult, but don't expect an A without some effort. If you study like you are supposed to for tests, as in not just the night before, it is a good class that isn't too stressful. I really enjoyed professor Broaders and thought she gave good anecdotes and real world examples."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think this class is a worthwhile choice for any student in University as it helps you learn more about yourself and the world around you, and it can even improve your quality of life."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class covers a lot of content very quickly but I would say everything we learn about is interesting. For exams, I would recommend reading the book and doing the practice quizzes multiple times since you get different questions every time, and exam questions are similar to the practice quizzes. I would also try and get study guides from people who have taken other sections of the class since Broaders did not provide us with study guides; I found the study guides to be especially useful for the first exam."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Intro Psych with Professor Broaders is a solid 6/10 would take again. There's a lot of reading and videos to do, but the practice quizzes and InQuizitive assignments make things more manageable. Also make sure to go to lectures because they are not recorded and are different from the textbook. I will say this is a class that probably fits better into a semester system and the squeeze of material into a quarter makes the list of things to do between each class feel long. If you might be interested in a psychology major take the class, but I don't think this will sway you one way or the other. All the exams were multiple choice and your highest 3/4 were taken."
,,,,,,,,,,,The best way to describe this class is a psych crash course. It skins the surface of a lot of differ topics within psych. It’s like ap psych but smashed I to 10 weeks. I did enjoy the class and Broaders is a solid lecturer
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class isn't too hard. If you stay on top of your work and do the assignments as you go, you won't be overwhelmed by the time the tests come around. Also, Prof. Broaders is a great lecturer and gives fun demonstrations. Sometimes the tests would include things we never talked about, which would make them more difficult than they should be."
wnbg,psych,201,fall,John Michael Bailey,4.49,4.49,4.49,4.03,4.30,4.23,"I did not have many expectations going in, so I was satisfied with the content covered."
,,,,,,,,,,,this class was pretty easy. Bailey creates modules with all the information you need for each topic that are helpful for reviewing. there are weekly homework and team exercises that are pretty easy once you get used to completing them. all exams were lockdown browser on canvas.
,,,,,,,,,,,okay class. try to take with bailey if you have to take it. midterm and final are pretty straightforward. the weekly modules ended up taking more time than anticipated but weren't too challenging. Bailey is a fine teacher but super super slow and repetitive. classes were a bore to say at the least
,,,,,,,,,,,"You learn a lot while not spending too much time on the material and as long as you stay up to date with the material the class is not difficult. He makes it interesting, but sometimes class feels like a waste of time"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this course, it is great. I had absolutely zero experience in statistics (no AP, no nothing) and the content is presented in a clear manner and I was able to get an A without too much effort. Prof. Bailey is a humorous lecturer and class was good for reinforcing content. The course is laid out such that you have 9 modules, each with 2 weekly assignments: a team assignment and an individual assignment. I'd recommend reading the module material prior to class, as class just reinforces these topics. The assignments are very streamlined, not very difficult, and are simply canvas quizzes. We used a software called JMP, which was pretty easy to navigate and we only really used a few button combinations. The grading is 60% assignments and 20% midterm and 20% final. The midterm was medium difficulty, but you can do well as long as you put in the effort to learn each module and practice the concepts in the assignments. The final was less difficult in my opinion, and really just involved applying the tests we used throughout the quarter to a few real–world situations. If you struggle with concepts, always go to Prof. Bailey's office hours (or your TAs) as he is incredibly approachable and very helpful, also awesome to have a conversation with. Overall, I wouldn't say this class is an easy A (it may be for some people), but definitely worth your time if you put in even a small amount of effort."
,,,,,,,,,,,really easy to follow. the content pages that prof posts in modules are incredibly well–written and helpful if you need clarification about material from lecture.
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was not too challenging. It is important to do well on the homework assignments and team exercises because they are weighted heavily but even if you don't attend lectures it is possible to do well on them.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, I enjoyed the course. I'm glad I felt excited to learn new things."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you're a psych major, this will be an easy A to knock out! There are no readings and the weekly assignments usually take less than an hour. Half the final was open note. The lectures are SUPER boring, but paying attention during these will help minimize the time you spend outside of class. Work with your TEAM!! Even if it's kind of a hassle to make time to meet, it will benefit you so much to have people to work through the problems with. There are a good number of homeworks/team assignments, so one or two bad grades literally won't affect your grade. Prof. Bailey is a bit of an oddball, but he did his best to keep us engaged with statistics. Overall, this class will make you feel like a STEM boss even though you are actually just clicking some buttons in a computer program!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I came into this class dreading it and actually had a really good time! I am not a math person, but Professor Bailey explained things in a very easy to understand way. I feel like I actually understood what I was learning and doing. I would say lectures could be a bit dry simply because the material is dry, but honestly a good, easy distro."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty easy class. The professor is cool, he is pretty funny. There is weekly homework that takes about 30 minutes a week. The midterm was pretty easy and I have yet to take the final."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Bailey is wonderful! He cares a lot about statistics and his students and is an excellent lecturer. The material is not particularly challenging, and if you do end up having any questions about it, there are plenty of resources at your disposal (especially your assigned study group)."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Bailey was very engaging and made sure everyone had a general understanding of each lesson. The group–work portion of the class also provided nice peer support.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Fun chill teacher, genuinely helps you learn"
,,,,,,,,,,,Class was kind of hard to follow but I just went through the modules on the canvas. Not a hard class but not super interesting either.
,,,,,,,,,,,I liked this class. The work was quite manageable even if you have never taken statistics before. Make good notes it will help you towards the end of the term as the final is open note.
,,,,,,,,,,,Better than taking a regular stats class! Class wasn’t to bad at all just make sure you stay on top of homework and group assignments and you’ll be fine
,,,,,,,,,,,"Basic review of AP Statistics from high school. Two assignmnets per week, one group and one independent. Virtual exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,Super easy and great instruction. Awesome materials online.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is one of the best classes I've ever taken. Bailey is probably the best teacher I've ever had. Go to lecture, you learn a ton and it's very fun, especially if you're mathy or love stats. Also has nothing to do with Psych, it's basically an intro to stats class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, this class wasn't extremely challenging. Assignments included two weekly homework assignments, one of which you had to complete with your assigned team (there was one week when you also had to post a discussion); two exams, which were online w/ lockdown browser."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great formal studies distro, and it's a very manageable class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was really fun! Professor Bailey was engaging, and I was lucky enough to have a really smart and helpful study group."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was not super challenging but the concepts aren't easy. The homework and team exercises weekly are helpful. I also think the midterm was fair and nothing was surprising. There is one midterm and one final so this class isn't too stressful throughout the quarter. Sometimes lectures were boring but I would recommend reading his module overviews because those are SUPER clear. The professor is funny and nice.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I took stat 210 but they made me take psych 201 anyway, so this class wasn't really anything to me academically. don't take this class with j michael bailey whatever you do, bad man bad class"
,,,,,,,,,,,"J Bailey was a good teacher, I would say that it was too slow of a pace so I sometimes did not go to lectures. However, I learned a ton of stats and actually really enjoyed it!! Take this class! Also the tests were actually the easiest things ever. There is no reason to not get an A in this class"
,,,,,,,,,,,If you have to take this for a psych minor or major don’t be intimidated it’s not the worst but it’s definitely not the best. It’s a doable course if you pay attention and actually read the content pages.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course itself isn't too bad, but John isn't the most engaging professor. 2 hours felt way too long for this class and he'd go on for so long during the lectures that wasted so much of my time. The instructional material helped way more than even going to class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is very manageable. Most of your grade is determined by group assignments that are not difficult. There is a midterm and a final, which both that you can take online. The lowest grade you can get in the class is a B."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this course if you need an easy distro or stats requirement. JMB is super sweet and I cannot stress enough how little work I needed to do in this class. We have two assignments every week, one group assignment and one individual one, and they are both easy if you pay attention in class or read the canvas module. He posts EVERYTHING on canvas and goes over the exact same material in class so literally just read those and you'll be fine for homework and the midterm. Make a couple friends, work together, and you won't be stressed at all."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I felt like it connected pretty loosely to psychology, so if you are only taking this course for the psychology aspect, you may want to reconsider."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very easy and enjoyable class. Lectures are focused on making you understand why you use certain statistical analyses rather than focusing on you memorizing equations. For this reason, homework and exams were easy to accomplish."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was fine. Bailey is sometimes rude and condescending, it really is just a get through the class type course. You really don't have to go to class that much, I went and most times I was so miserably bored I would literally just play games on my phone. The modules are great and this class is very much a class where the instruction gives you nothing especially after the first midterm. The tests were extremely fair though, honestly they were easy."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Bailey is a bit eccentric, but this class really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. My best advice is to make sure you're really close with your team, since you'll be doing group assignments with them every week and it can be helpful to have a group of people to talk about the class with throughout the quarter. My group worked really well together and I felt a lot more comfortable in the class because of it–– we'd work on the group assignment each week and sometimes the homework as well. The midterm was fair, the first part of the final was a bit unexpected and the second part of the final was challenging but basically what I expected. Prof Bailey does his best to make the content engaging, but at the end of the day this is kind of a class you've just gotta get through. All in all I enjoyed it though!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought this class was pretty easy but honestly pretty boring. Stat psych is def easier than normal psych and I had to take this class for my psych minor, so I'm glad I took it. However, I didn't feel like I learned much from the class. I stopped going half way through and taught myself from the modules posted on canvas and felt like that was a better use of my time."
,,,,,,,,,,,The most important aspects were the lecture and notes on canvas that the instructor sometimes did not go over.
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was formatted well. We had weekly homework assignments due in addition to weekly team exercises due. These weren't difficult and it the homework and team exercises were usually similar. The Midterm and Final weren't bad.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was absurdly easy and the professor has a good sense of humor. The TAs were very nice, and the professor did a great job of emphasizing why good and responsible statistical analysis is so important to the scientific community. I feel I learned what I needed to from this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is an easy class if you put in some effort. You can get away with not doing the readings as long as you go to class. Stay on top of your work and at least know the basics of each week.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was very manageable for a formal studies distro. Prof Bailey is really knowledgeable and the course assignments furthered the learning we did in class. It is fairly fast paced but not hard to stay on top of. Assignments consisted of weekly homework and team assignments, a midterm exam, and a final. The midterm and final were in line with the content from class and didn't feel like a trick."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was great. Around half of it was seen before in AP Statistics, but the other half which was a little more complex was built off of these concepts which were refreshed by Professor Bailey. Professor Bailey is so sweet and very understanding, so I highly recommend this class, especially because the workload is also beyond manageable and assignments, which are not very time consuming, are helpful for preparing students for exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Easy distro for those who can easily grasp mathematical concepts. Make sure you doublecheck your homework and team homeworks, they are a big portion of the grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was a good class and pretty straightforward. You go to lectures (even though they were sometimes boring, especially the days where he just played around in JMP), read the material on Canvas, do the team assignment, and do the homework. I didn't really learn anything new and thought the class was pretty easy, but if you have no background in statistics, it may be a bit more challenging."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is a great low–pressure class that teaches basic statistical concepts and how they're applied in psychology research. Prof. Bailey goes nice and slow in lectures and provides you all the notes you need on Canvas. Weekly assignments include 1 team exercise and 1 individual homework assignment, both of which are pretty straightforward and don't take long at all."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Easy formal studies distro requirement if you have a stat background. Bailey was simple to follow. Not really a need to attend lectures, but you can get your fair share of corny stat jokes if you do."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Bailey is a great lecturer, and he throws in a few jokes in class which made me feel like I was in a fever dream sometimes but that's a good thing in my opinion. As for the course content and structure, the group exercises and homeworks were both similar to each other and weren't too difficult with the help of your team and the overviews on Canvas which had walk–throughs on how to conduct each type of statistical test and how to write conclusions. Midterm and final were representative of the course content, as well, and resembled the group exercises and homeworks. No work took too long to complete, which made it a great course to have when my other classes picked up on their course load."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As someone who only took an intro stats class in high school, I had limited exposure to the subject. It did take me a little while to understand the content considering the pace that the instructor will teach at. Genuinely, I feel like I didn’t get a good grasp on the topic."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is very practical, so I understand why it is required by the Psychology major. The team exercises and homework are very useful in learning how to use statistical software and run different tests and I do think that actually practicing and doing the work is the best way to learn."
wnbg,psych,201,winter,Harry David Smith,5.00,4.46,4.90,4.59,4.37,4.08,"Professor Smith really encourages collaboration in his classes through Team Tasks, which are a big part of your grade. He is a very nice person who teaches in a clear and concise way, it is rare to be confused in his class. The topics are straightforward, homework is assigned so you can learn concepts instead of being busy work. Since this is a requirement for Psych, I highly recommend taking the class with him"
,,,,,,,,,,,The lectures could be a bit boring but the class was overall pretty easy.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a good intro to statistics for someone who hasn't taken it before. The material was well organized, and it was relatively easy to follow along and understand the concepts within a short period of time. However, the grading was somewhat hard to understand as most assignments would only be graded weeks after they were due, and at times the grades were relatively harsh for only minor mistakes (direction of hypothesis, calculation errors on last step of problem, etc.) Also the TAs, while nice, weren't the most helpful resources, and they also provided incomplete information at times (on accident) that made it a lot harder to follow along with the course material. That being said, Professor Smith was very approachable, and going to his office hours was far more helpful than I expected. I ended up finding him to be a better resource than the TAs whenever I had questions, and in general, he ran the course well."
,,,,,,,,,,,Good class. Exams are not too difficult.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm really glad I took this class with Professor Smith, he made the subject engaging and more approachable and was super helpful and passionate about teaching."
,,,,,,,,,,,Good class not as hard as people make it out to be just attend lecture
,,,,,,,,,,,Not that hard but a little boring – extra credit tasks were great and the group work was also nice– going to class is important but not much outside class work– overall good class
,,,,,,,,,,,"As someone who is not great with math, this is a very approachable class. Professor Smith does a great job of presenting the material in an easy–to–digest manner. The lectures sometimes feel a bit boring, but do provide good explanations for the material, especially what will be on the exams. This is a great class for fulfilling a formal studies distro."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think that this course was a really good introduction to statistics in psychology. Everything was clearly explained, and all of the examples that were given were easy to understand. The team tasks, or the group activities, were not always great. They affect your grade quite a bit, and because we do not get feedback on them, it is difficult to know how we can improve for the next one. It is also not known how the team tasks are graded, so I didn't know if it was an individual mistake I was making, or if it was a mistake that showed up on the group sheet. The firs exam was a little intimidating, but completely doable if you made sure to review lectures and practice older team task questions, and redo homework assignments. Understanding how to compute things is just as important as conceptually understanding them."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is really easy as long as you actually pay attention, take notes, remember the team tasks, and go to office hours/ask for help when you need it. The concepts are super easy to grasp even if you don't attend every lecture. I would recommend not buying the textbook for this course because you really don't need it at all. The lectures provide you with more than enough content and everything that's on homework and exams is just like the team tasks for the most part."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is not an overtly difficult class, though you do need to pay attention in order to understand the key concepts. There is quite a bit of work involved as there are quizzes and homework due almost every week as well as in–class team tasks, but it is manageable. The midterm and final combined are only 50% of the total grade (25% each) making getting an A in the class not difficult. The class itself is not the most interesting, but it is a very basic intro to stats course that would be great to take if you need stats credit or even just as a distro."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is meh. I did not connect with the Professor and found his lecture style to be hard to follow, but I think that is personal preference. I wish we were given far more practice problems, especially before the exams. I liked that we did group work each week because that is when I felt I actually started understanding the assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm not a big fan of stats, but this class was fairly straight forward and easy to follow along. The work outside of the class was really manageable and working as a team in class was fun. Honestly, take this class as a distro if you want and if you're a psych major who doesn't like math, know that you will be fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Smith is kind of a boring lecturer, and he didn’t really make the class fun. Also, psych stats it’s pretty hard! You have to study to do well, I wouldn’t say it’s an easy A."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The prof. is very hard to listen to because he has a hard time projecting. Two of the TA's were also very snarky and scoffed at what they deemed as ""bad questions."" I think that this class also moves too quickly, and there needs to be at least one statistical test that gets removed from the lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Smith is a great professor who makes statistics super clear. That being said, if you’re mathematically inclined, this is gonna be pretty straightforward for you. My only complaint about this class is the team tasks. They are a complete waste of time, and if you’re good at math, you’ll spend the whole class doing all of the work for your teammates."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class for the formal studies distro. The professor is nice and engaging. He posts lecture slides which is great but he does not record lecture. You are split into groups that you will do 8 team tasks with during the quarter and your group all gets the same grade which can be tough if other people do not know what they are doing. The quizzes and homeworks are not bad. There is one midterm and one final, if you prepare for them you will do fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Stats is a class that you can use universally. Even though I did not have any experience taking a formal studies, I thought it was important to take something that could help me with whatever I was doing. I learned skills I can now take with me wherever I go."
,,,,,,,,,,,good bistro if you don't like math but it's doable
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not terrible, especially for a required class, but professor Smith could sometimes make it harder than it needed to be to understand concepts and stuff."
,,,,,,,,,,,Office hours were very helpful and the course is supportive of students who do not have a background in statistics.
,,,,,,,,,,,"We have eight team tasks which complicate a lot of things. Professor Smith doesn't seem to plan the class very well sometimes. But time commitment required outside of classroom is rather low. If you expect to learn a lot, maybe take it with another professor."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Smith is awesome! I was really dreading taking a stats class but it was pretty chill and interesting. =+ organized professor, good practice, computations are pretty easy (coming from a non–stem person), – quizzes every week, multiple choice is hard, need to study"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class with Professor Smith!!!! His teaching style is so great, especially if you're someone who wasn't really into statistics before you took the course. The class was low–stress which played a huge role in how much I learned. I had a great team for the team tasks and learned a lot from those as well. There are plenty of opportunities in class to practice and ask questions. HDS is a wonderful instructor and I will actually take the information I learned into future classes here. All around great class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Smith was a great professor. Math isn't my favorite topic, but he made everything easy to understand and none of the homework/exams were unnecessarily difficult. I wouldn't have taken this class if it wasn't a major requirement, but it definitely wasn't a bad course."
,,,,,,,,,,,it is important to know when to use each test and how they can be manipulated
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is very simple and hand–holdy, so easy if you have any experience/comfort with stats. If not, some of the concepts around later methods can get confusing."
,,,,,,,,,,,Overall I liked this course and learned a lot. There are weekly group tests that give you a great opportunity to check your understanding of the material and meet people in your class. Professor Smith is very kind and understanding and willing to meet with students outside of class. There is a textbook but you can do well in the class without ever using it. Multiple opportunities for extra credit were also provided.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Smith is very good at explaining statistical concepts and putting them in terms that are understood by students who aren't particularly math oriented. As someone who took AP stats in high school, this class was an absolute breeze. I barely paid attention in class; just go over the notes as you need to for the quizzes and homework and you'll be fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"While Dr. David Smith is a good professor, and I learned a lot in this class, it is unfair that other stats classes get a cheat sheet with the during exams and we don't. The exams are extremely doable, but I don't understand how one class can offer a cheat sheet while the other doesn't. The lecture slides often had poor formatting and the use of variables sometimes changed across equations which could be confusing. That being said, it was a decent class and Dr. David Smith is one of the nicest professor I've ever had. He is extremely kind and understanding. I would recommend this class"
,,,,,,,,,,,"As someone who had never taken a statistics course before, there was definitely a learning curve with this class. The concepts were pretty difficult to grasp at first, but it definitely got easier with time (the team tasks and homeworks also helped you understand the material). Professor Smith is incredibly kind and helpful, and he's very accessible when you need him. My only complaint is that the lectures moved pretty fast, and there was a lot of material to cover."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not an easy A. To be fair, I am in no way a math person so I had to work hard for the grade and found it helpful to create study groups out of class. 6 quizzes, 10 team tasks and 2 exams (cumulative) and they're graded pretty harshly. The lectures go really fast but everything is on the slides and he pretty much just reiterates it so you don't technically have to go to class. Even in office hours, he has a difficult time explaining it in a different way so if you don't get a topic the first time, good luck. Prof. Smith is very kind and wants you to succeed but in my experience, you either get it or you don't. That being said, he is VERY accommodating with special cirumstances."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved PSYCH 201 with Professor Smith! Overall, the course was paced very well and the work was never too difficult, although he sometimes went through his slides a bit too quickly. Smith was kind, understanding, knowledgeable, and a good statistics teacher. If you are a psych major/minor and need to take this course, I would highly recommend doing it with Smith!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof Smith is great at explaining the content and explains things in an engaging way. His slides were really well organized too. He really wants to see the whole class succeed so its pretty easy to catch up if you feel like you're behind.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Literally take this class with anyone else unless you want to teach yourself. Not only will you have to teach yourself, in additional you’ll have to learn how to do things this specific professor’s way or else you’ll do poorly on the exams. The final is covering some things we literally never practiced outside of the optional final review session. Prof is not helpful at all in answering questions and he seems to have no idea how to teach undergrads. He’d ask the class if something made sense, get silence and blank stares, and move on as if everyone said they got it. TAs and prof give conflicting advice too; no one seems to know what they’re doing. This course had no reason to be this difficult. Genuinely one of the worst professors I’ve ever had."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this course and found it very doable despite the fact that I have no background in statistics. Lots of opportunities to raise your grade which was good. Professor Smith is very nice and approachable, as well as just a very good professor. I really recommend this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is exactly what you'd expect. It wasn't difficult if you pay attention to lecture. The readings weren't necessary. Typically each week consists of one lecture, one in–class team task, one take home quiz, and one short homework assignment. The quizzes and homework were easy. There's also a midterm that I didn't feel reflected how we were asked to do things in class, but it still wasn't too hard. The only thing I didn't like was that the team tasks consist of individual work and a small group section, but your grade depends on how everyone does. So even if you do everything right, a group member could bring your grade down and there's not a lot of time to check other people's work."
,,,,,,,,,,,Take this course with Professor Smith. The class is structured very well and professor HDS wants everyone to succeed. HW is short and effective as well. This course also sparked my interest in statistics. I am so glad I took this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"2 exams, 6 hw's, 6 quizzes, 8 team tasks! Work is not hard at all, HDS is a great professor."
,,,,,,,,,,,Would recommend Prof. Smith for this class. Really cares for his students and open to any questions.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a good distribution course. Dr. Smith is a good lecturer. The computations are not too difficult, and there are plenty of opportunities to get help with anything you don't understand."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was nervous about taking a statistics course, but this class exceeded my expectations. There is a weekly quiz (15% of your grade), team task (20% of your grade), and weekly homework assignment (15% of your grade), but I only spent about 30 minutes per week on the assignments (outside of studying for exams). The quizzes can be confusing at times, and the team tasks can be frustrating sometimes because everyone in your team gets the same score (so someone else's mistake could negatively impact your grade), but overall this course was very manageable. Exams are fair, and you will do well if you study and understand the homework, team tasks, and quizzes. The material is not super difficult, but the class can be long sometimes. However, overall, this course is very fair, not too challenging, and the professor is so kind."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is not that difficult, but it is important to stay up to date with lectures and notes in class. There is one homework assignment and one quiz a week that are both really easy and the midterm was definitely harder."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class isn't hard, but you have to stay on top of all the deadlines on your own because there are no reminders whatsoever. There's take home quizzes, but make sure you know when it opens and closes because it will open for 24 hours and then close (check the syllabus). There's group assignments, which is nice since it's not lecture and you can meet new people. You stay with the same group all quarter and do a worksheet. Lectures were ok. Prof. Smith is nice, but it's just him talking through 50 slides for 1 hr 20 minutes. I'm also not used to learning math through slides, so it was harder for me to understand, but definitely make sure to go to office hours. Overall, it could've been more engaging, but I don't think it's a bad class, especially if you need the stats requirement, and the material is useful."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Smith was very nice and accomadating.
wnbg,psych,201,spring,Benjamin Gorvine,5.59,5.17,5.07,4.70,5.19,4.05,"This course was challenging, but not unfair. Every week there is a quiz, team exercise, and homework, but its a good amount of points and provides a lot of opportunities."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's hard to summarize my feelings on this class. For one, I am not great at math, so I went into this class pretty nervous. However, I think Professor Gorvine did all he could do equalize the playing field between those who suck at math (me) and those who are good at it. He put us all into groups based on a preliminary assessment we took, and that group was my lifeline in the class. Every week, when we did team assignments with our groups, I picked up the material WAY better than I would if I had to do everything on my own. It then made it easier to do follow–up homework. I would say I struggled to understand a lot of the conceptual information, especially because so much information was thrown at us in such a short time. However, there was a lot of things built into the course to ensure that those with different strengths could do well. We had weekly quizzes (which I was not a fan of), team assignments, and homework assignments. We also had a media report worth 5% of our grade, two midterms, and some extra credit stuff. I like that it was not all based on two exams. I think Professor Gorvine is incredibly fair in the way the class was structured, and though I did not like the class, I think I tolerated it as best I could given the fact that I really don't like being in math classes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is pretty easy, but the exams are more of a time crunch than you would expect. Prof Gorvine is very nice and knows the material very, very well so be sure to ask him questions as they come up. Also, it's a lot of very small math things, which can get annoying at times, but for the most part likely the easiest stats course you can take here."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gorvine is an amazing professor and explains the concepts so well. This is a great introductory course to statistics for anyone to learn, even if you have no prior experience. If you have to take an intro class or stats class, take this one. There are team exercises about every week but these help you work through problems to understand the concepts. There are also weekly quizzes and 2 exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Everyone takes this class for a reason, its an easy psych major requirement especially if you already have a stats background. Professor Gorvine and the TA's are wonderful and very helpful for the weekly team exercises, my advice for that is literally just ask them to check in every step of the way and you will get an A. If your team is struggling its because they're not using the TA's."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall I had a positive experience in this course. The lectures were very clear and easy to follow and the exams mirrored lecture content which made them easy to prepare for. The weekly homework was helpful in checking your understanding and getting personalized feedback. My only complaint about this course was the group work. Being graded on your group members work seemed like an unfair way to facilitate group collaboration. In my personal experience I had a group that didn't understand the material very well, didn't ask questions, and rarely checked their work. For me this meant I was doing the worksheet 5 times every week because I was going to be docked for their mistakes. While I see the value in the group work I think students should be able to opt out of it or choose their own groups."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you're gonna take Psych stats or need to fulfill any introductory stats requirements TAKE THIS with Professor Gorvine. He makes the learning incredibly digestible and surprisingly fun, with group work to help us better understand the work."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Gorvine is such an incredible professor!! I am a Psych Minor and an Engineering Major, so statistics and math are something I do already like, however Dr. Gorvine still makes it so much more fun and interesting! I really like the group exercises we have every week as it gives everyone a chance to actually apply what we've learned before we move onto a new topic. Overall just great course that I would recommend taking for a stats requirement!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Gorvine is amazing!! His lectures were a little long but since it was twice a week it is understandable. The format of Monday lectures and Wednesday team exercises worked very well for me. It allowed me time to understand the material after the lecture, and then apply it while being able to get help. The TAs were very active in this course and helped a lot during Wed classes. They are also super quick with responding to emails about any questions. It seemed daunting that we were paired with random people and had to work with them, but honestly, everyone wants to succeed and get a good grade so everyone helped everyone. Homeworks were the same as the Wed questions, so it benefits you to go. The weighting of each category is not extreme. Midterm 2/Final is not cumulative. There's extra credit with the TopHat/clicker questions which helps that small bit if you're on the edge of a letter grade. Prof. Gorvine is also super helpful with an access code for it if you don't want to pay. He is honestly so fun with the meme competitions too and giving out little treats for all of us. Take it with him if you can!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,THIS IS AN AMAZING COURSE.Professor Gorvine is the best human you'll ever meet. He's an amazing professor and person.He's always there to support his student.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor was ok in explaining concepts, what mainly helped me understand coursework was the team exercises in class. Slides were kinda confusing"
,,,,,,,,,,,Take this class! Professor Gorvine is awesome. The class is not that challenging and I enjoyed the team exercises. The 2 exams are not that hard either as long as you make a detailed formula sheet.
,,,,,,,,,,,Great stats course! Prof Gorvine is literally the best. Low stress but you’ll learn at the same time. Highly recommend
,,,,,,,,,,,professor gorvine was AWESOMEEEEEE. I never wanted to ever take stats and this class was required but it was easy and fun and great. Highly recommend. He even did a meme competition.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is not an easy A but you are given the resourced to be successful. The weekly lectures and group work allow for better understanding of material. The weekly quizzes are confusing, they took me a while to get the hang of what they are asking. Overall, Professor Grovine is always willing to help and his lectures are easy to follow and enjoyable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Firstly, Gorvine is absolutely amazing. Super sweet human being, genuinely invested in his students' success, very receptive to all questions and willing to help + he would buy students cheeseballs and Girl Scout cookies from time to time. Take this class with Gorvine, absolutely no exceptions. As someone who absolutely despises math, Gorvine truly made this experience so so enjoyable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Computations are super simple, but the conceptual nature of each formula and subject can be a challenge."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gorvine is the best! He is so kind and really wants his students do learn and do well. He is extremely approachable and always there to help. The material in the lectures can be a bit boring, but he really does a great job at making the material as engaging as possible by implementing team activities. Great course overall!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was as good as any required statistics class could be. The group work was especially helpful and Professor Gorvine made the class even better!
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class had a good structure that helped me learn but was not too overwhelming, the materials were beneficial, and the lectures were informative."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this course with Prof. Gorvine! He truly cares about his students and makes a required class for psych majors/minors interesting. The set up of the class is also done really well. One day a week are lecture days and the other day is a team exercise. Even if you do not like team learning, it is designed well where and no one gets left behind/is able to do all of the work. There is weekly homework, but it is relatively short and mirrors the team activity of that week. Quizzes once a week that are mainly based on conceptual knowledge. Midterm and final are fair. Overall, Prof. Gorvine does a fantastic job making this class enjoyable!"
,,,,,,,,,,,The content in the course isn't too difficult and there are only 2 exams which are definitely a little challenging but the rest of the grading system makes up and helps inflate your grade.
,,,,,,,,,,,"as long as you go to class, review the material, the class was straightforward."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class moved very quickly from topic to topic, but overall was manageable in terms of work. As long as you review the concepts briefly before Team exercises, you’ll be able to stay on track."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Fairly easy course, make sure you do the homework and team exercises and you'll be fine. The professor is very helpful."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was a commitment. It was very time consuming and annoying considering there were weekly quizzes, homeworks, team excercises, and two exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is not meant to be hard and isn't, especially if you stay on top of your work. I thought the group work was super nice and it's a great class. Prof. Gorvine is AMAZING (take it with him if you can!) Would highly recommend this class. It is super easy to do well. Some may find it a little boring, but I thought it was a nice way to ease into statistics."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty easy for a math class, coming from someone who does not like math. Half of the class is group work, which I was so scared about because I usually *hate* group work, but I promise that in this class it's not bad at all –– the groups are super chill and I honestly probably wouldn't have passed the class without mine so they were super helpful. The professor's way of explaining things can sometimes be a little confusing and roundabout, but he's a super nice guy and really wants to help you."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a good stat class to take with Professor Gorvine. The way the class is formatted helps you stay on top of things and actually learn the information.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would try to take this class with Professor Gorvine because he was such an enthusiastic lecturer and never made the course more confusing than it was! He would always try to spice up the class with funny memes, girl scout cookies, and just classic dad humor. The class was very fair with 2 exams, a series of online Canvas quizzes, and weekly homework and team exercises. It made for a very enjoyable and relatively low–stress experience for a Northwestern class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Gorvine was a great instructor who explained things clearly! His slides were always informative and he had such a nice sense of humor. I recommend taking a class with him!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gorvine is great. He is very knowledgeable and explains concepts well, however it gets really difficult to bear the hour twenty minute lectures. The topic of the class is just not that interesting, and its challenging to listen to info about z–scores for longer than 10 minutes. However, take this instead of stat 210 if you can. Great alternative if it gives you introductory stats courses, saves you a lot of pain in stat 210"
,,,,,,,,,,,gorvine is the best!! so nice and funny and wants everyone to do well. i was worried coming into this class because i cannot do math but its seriously so manageable and easy to follow. highly highly reccomend
,,,,,,,,,,,"I found it very interesting how real life uses a lot of statistics especially with understanding correlations between variables and the various tests used for different conditions. As well as the critical thinking aspect of understanding that correlation may not always imply causation and that confounding variables, variability, bias, and experimental errors should be considered as well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"DONT BUY THE BOOK, YOU DONT NEED IT. If you took AP Stats in high school, this is insanely easy."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is very straightforward, I would suggest even if you are not a Psych major or minor to take this course if you need a stats requirement!"
,,,,,,,,,,,I think stats is pretty tough and kinda boring regardless of who teaches it but Prof.Gorvine did a very good job making it interesting. It's not too hard and I enjoyed groupwork.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely an easy class, I don't know how much I actually retained, because you didn't really need to pay attention to do well. The group work ended up kind of hurting my grade, but I think for the most part this class is set up for people to do well."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is amazing! I love prof Gorvine he made stats fun. The hw and outside commitments for this class are very mild. Take this class is you are pre med
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Gorvine was super nice and understanding!
,,,,,,,,,,,"IF YOU NEED STATS (and like really need a class with a lot of support) TAKE THIS CLASS!! Basically we would do lectures on Mondays and team questions on Wednesdays so with that as well as homework (super lowkey, one question) and quizzes (lockdown browser but conceptual and lowkey) and readings (LOTS, stay ahead on that), I really learned a lot and had that knowledge well reinforced. Prof Gorvine is super engaging (and fun! he's gotten us a lot of treats like girl scout cookies) and has worked in a lot of options for extra credit/grade buffers which is nice. But overall, this class made me like stats!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"gorvine is such a great guy, but sometimes the class just gets really boring, even though gorvine tries his best."
,,,,,,,,,,,Gorvine is amazing in this course. Most of the material is pretty straight forward. Some of the questions on the quizzes were tedious and worded strangely. Group work and homework was very helpful when it came to exams. There is extra credit and partial credit so it's always worth trying than leaving something blank. A lot goes into your grade so exams are very worrisome
,,,,,,,,,,,"Gorvine is a really kind and accommodating professor. The course was very well organized and clearly structured, and lectures were easy to follow on slides if I missed a class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a great introductory course to statistics, and it made it more interesting when it get connected it to Psychology or experiments and studies. It added a sense of purpose to all the numbers and calculations."
,,,,,,,,,,,Fine class... Have to do the readings or you're not going to know what is going on... that part is kind of annoying... anyway there are weekly quizzes/homeworks/group assignments. Grading is fair. You probably have to take the class... taking it with Ben is great.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gorvine is truly the best!! He makes it so easy to understand and digest I really loved his teaching style, he’s also so kind and understanding!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Im not good at math so this class was hard, but if you put in the effort you should succeed. Professor Gorvine is such a great professor and super understanding!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Slides were confusing to follow could have been organized but ok clas
,,,,,,,,,,,"I am not a math person in fact I have dropped every calc course that I've taken here, but this course was AMAZING! Yes, Prof. Gorvine tends to speak a lot and over explain certain topics, but he gives you all necessary formulas and options to succeed. You have one team assignment (done during class), one homework assignment, and a quiz that has to be done every Monday before class, since our class was at 11am, the quiz had to be completed between the hours of 9–11. Gorvine is very accomodating, and will switch your timeslot if necessary. Take this course with GORVINE! No one else!!!!!!!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Easy A if you are good at basic math.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I am not the biggest fan of math, however professor Gorvine made this course very digestable & the content very manageable. He was always willing to help, and each assignment he gave us genuinely helped me to understand the content better."
,,,,,,,,,,,"fun class, pretty easy, grade is mostly based on all the group assignments which are fun and easy"
,,,,,,,,,,,Ben is such a great guy and caring prof
,,,,,,,,,,,TAKE THIS CLASS! Gorvine will make sure you understand the concepts. I LOVE THIS MAN. He's a good prof and person. He's really good at explaining things thoroughly and the content isn't too bad.
,,,,,,,,,,,"HAD TO TAKE IT FOR THE MINOR, GORVINE MADE THE BORING CLASS FUN"
,,,,,,,,,,,NA
,,,,,,,,,,,"professor gorvine is the best, take this class with him if possible. he's so good at explaining concepts and is so helpful and down to earth. he definitely played a huge part in making this class a positive experience."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class did not have a lot of homework, the instructor is very nice, flexible, and fair. He tries his best to keep everyone engaged in the lecture and offers extra credit and accommodations all the time."
,,,,,,,,,,,A very basic stats course. Prof. Gorvine is what made this class fun. The homework and group work are very easy as is the media report. The tests are also not too hard.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course did not require a lot of time outside of class, but the lectures inside of class presented a lot of information in a short amount of time. The exams were take home as well, so overall the course was pretty easy."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think this course was structured really well. There are lectures on Mondays and on Wednesdays, you complete a team exercise with your team of other students which is randomly selected at the beginning of the quarter. You are expected to read the textbook, but if you come to lecture on Mondays, it will just serve as a review for the quizzes (there were six quizzes throughout the quarter). The team exercises give you a chance to practice the statistical methods you learn about in lecture, and they are usually pretty close conceptually to what you need to do in the homework assignments (there are 6 of these too). Overall, going to lecture and the team exercise sets you up to do well in the course. Professor Gorvine is also really nice, and you can tell he wants to help his students succeed. If you have a choice of either this class or Stats 202 I would recommend this one. The structure just makes it a lot easier (not comparatively, just generally) to understand the material."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class, awesome professor. Gorvine is so cool– I wish I could have gone to more of his office hours. Assignments are well paced so that as long as you do the required work, you will learn the material by practice."
wnbg,psych,205,fall,Paul Reber),4.00,4.50,4.30,3.76,3.71,5.80,"Its research methods in psych. Its gonna be subjective at times and grading wont always feel fair. But go to office hours, try your best, and see what you can do. It will be over soon"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a lot of work however I don't think I can say this about other courses but this course really prepares you for research papers. I learned so much through this course and I am not even a psych major. I was able to apply this to MCAT studying, understanding and writing research papers in independent studies, and overall understanding of terms that I often do not think of. This class also makes you so critical of what to expect in research papers such as going in depth, thinking of all the boundaries, constraints, other variables, etc."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was not the best, but was a requirement for my psych minor. Professor Reber was definitely very passionate about research methods, however, he constantly talked about topics that were not relevant to lecture. He kept us in class 5–10 minutes over time, and would also cold call in class. He very much assumed we knew more about the topic than we did, and just called on us to tell us the correct answer anyway."
,,,,,,,,,,,Loved it
,,,,,,,,,,,"No the professor is subpar. He wrote the text he used to teach the class two nights before every class and then asked us to read it the night before. The lectures went over 10 minutes every single time. Moreover, the professor doesn't engage with students during lectures or discussions. No outside help is ever provided by him even when asked multiple times. For our final experiment for example we had various issues the entire time we were planning our design and instead of helping out he instructed me to look at the tutorials and help guides for the system which I expressed I already had. And after that fiasco he still got angry at us for the lack of understanding despite the multiple times we reached out for help."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Do not recommend taking the class with Prof Reber. 2 midterms, 2 research paper write–ups, 3 short weekly homework and conducting a final experiment and writing a paper on it. From what I've heard, other Profs teaching the course do not have midterms in their 205 classes. Write–ups graded relatively harshly. Choose your final group WISELY."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a nice class. The professor is really nice, but he always goes 5 to 7 minutes over the 50 minute mark so keep that in mind when you are picking out your classes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is required for Psych majors/minors, but maybe take this with someone other than Reber. There is a five–point HW assignment before every class which is just annoying busy work and feels pointless. There are three papers and two exams. Way too much work for this class and other professors give less work."
,,,,,,,,,,,Fine class with a pretty good professor. not the most interesting so take it only if you have to.
,,,,,,,,,,,"A class that you just have to get through. Prof. Reber likes to cold call from an attendance sheet for answering in–class questions which made going to class a lot more anxiety–inducing than I had expected. There are two exams and three papers, with the last being a write–up of a study you design and conduct. Really really glad it is over."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is incredibly boring, but pretty easy to get through if you're taking it for the minor. Workload is manageable. But don't take this class with Reber. He will take a month to give you grades and is completely unwilling to meet with his students."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is definitely important if you will ever be conducting research, and was very informational in terms of how to conduct different types of research correctly in an ethical way. Exams are very similar to homework and in class questions. The assignments were not difficult and there are opportunities to correct them after class, although this specific quarter was kind of weird since the textbook was being written as the course progressed. It felt like some things were thrown together a little last minute, but overall was manageable."
wnbg,psych,205,fall,Courtney Jones,5.60,4.50,4.30,5.70,4.20,5.80,"Pretty much every day of this class was a powerpoint lecture, which got old very quickly, especially because it was lots of review from Psych 110 and 201. The grading seemed extremely harsh and lectures were irrelevant to the projects. I have taken four psych classes in the department and this is by far the most difficult for seemingly no reason. Personally, I put a lot of time and effort into this class, but that did not pay off in learning."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was unique because 2 TAs taught it without a professor. They were both knowledgeable in their fields and facilitated a really efficient class model. Lectures could get dry at times but they were helpful and necessary nonetheless. Attendance was taken, but I'd recommend going to class regardless because a lot of content and instructions are covered. I don't think I would have taken this class if it weren't required for my major, but I had a really good experience nonetheless– the TAs were very accessible and clarified well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really good class. It does require a lot of work though, even though the work isn't that mentally challenging. The professors take you through how to write the papers step by step and make it really understandable. The class consists of three papers which get increasingly more difficult, however it is really doable. Loved having graduate students as the professors as they made the class more personable, as they are in similar situations as the undergraduates."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a necessary course to fulfill a requirement so you have to take it anyways. It can be boring at times but when you are writing a paper or conducting a study for your final it can get interesting. For this particular section, there are 2 midterm papers and one final paper as well as canvas discussions in between. The teachers are extremely nice and helpful. The workload is very manageable. I definitely recommend taking this course with Courtney and Eileen."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was taught by two teaching instructors so might've been easier than normal but overall it is what I expected. The research papers are hard and you have to follow very specific guidelines. Only take this class if you absolutely have to for the major or minor.

Start on the assignments early and get feedback, there will be things you have questions about and leaving them to the last minute is not good"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Chung is a really good lecturer – she is energetic, organized, and good at explaining difficult concepts, and she incorporates discussions and activities to make us feel engaged. She responds super fast to emails, and her office hours are also really helpful. Overall, I learned a lot about research and enjoyed this class a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is not too much work. You should make sure to get all writings and readings done in advance because it really helps and they build up fast. Professor Chung is wonderful and super helpful whenever I might've needed it. She is also very passionate about psychological research. I liked how we slowly worked towards completing an entire research paper throughout the quarter.
,,,,,,,,,,,"this class is meh. if you get to take it with chung, do so. she's great."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was tougher than I expected. If you're not strong in stats you will need to spend extra time with the prof to make sure you understand and can do well. Assignments were time consuming.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this course with Prof Chung! Not only is she so nice but she is also very willing to help. Though this is a required course for psych major, prof Chung makes it very engaging and I think I learned a lot. The papers are hard work, but they are also rewarding"
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Chung was very engaging and enthusiastic. She was great in answering questions both in person and over email
,,,,,,,,,,,"I know that this is a major requirement for psychology and people do not like it, but definitely take this course with professor Chung if you can! She made it a lot more bearable and cared a lot about making sure we really do well throughout the research process. She provided opportunity for help all of the time and the assignments were definitely not too overwhelming. Try to take it with Chung if you can!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class was alright, but I was surprised that I didn't really learn much about different research methods. I thought we would be going over different experiments and studies, but we spent the majority of the class learning how to write research papers, which was helpful but not what I thought the class was going to be."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take research methods with Alissa. It's not the best class ever, but she makes it interesting!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was really helpful to go through the process of conducting and writing up a study, even though it was a lot of time at the end of this course. Pick something that's interesting to you and it will make the big final project somewhat fun to do. Professor Chung is very approachable and wants to help you learn too. A manageable course– definitely recommend taking it with Prof. Chung!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR CHUNG! She is arguably one of the best professors in the Psychology department, if not across all departments at Northwestern. She is incredibly knowledgeable, approachable, patient, and capable. As a clinician, she is also very charismatic and friendly. Research Methods is notoriously difficult and tedious, and Professor Chung made it enjoyable. There are no exams, but four short (1–page) papers, 2 shorter study write–ups (~10 pages), and 1 final study project. No work other than these writings were truly mandatory. She broke down the writing super super clearly both in class verbally and on Canvas visually, so I never felt stressed as far as tackling the paper. She also lets you pick your own project group, so that led me to a really driven group for the final project."
,,,,,,,,,,,"if you have to take research methods, TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR CHUNG! She makes it as little work as possible for this class. 5 short (1 page) papers and 3 research papers (only full one is the last once since first 2 are shorter and build up to final one). She walks the class through everything they need to know and makes it as interesting as possible."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As a required psychology class, TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR CHUNG. SHE IS THE BEST. There are three papers to write and Prof Chung guides you through them, so it's relatively easy to do well in the course. GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS, she's the sweetest and SO HELPFUL. I feel like I could knock on her door any time and she would be happy to help. It is research methods so not the most excited, but with Prof Chung, you get the best of it."

He is super sweet and easy to talk to for questions about psychology in general or anything really since he's active on campus and is an advisor! He structured the class well so that there isn't too much of a workload, and the assignments/readings he assigns are super interesting to read! In terms of assignments, there are 2 short assignments that both have different options to choose from, 2 open–note exams, and 3 research papers that progressively get longer and more independent. I think all of the assignments were fair, and it was nice getting to work in groups for the last research paper! Definitely recommend taking it with Gorvine!"

This course is a lot of work, you have 1–2 midterms that are take home, three 6–ish page research reports, and several other writing assignments as well as readings for every class. But, if you need to take this class (which most people do because it is a core class for Psychology), you definitely want to take it with Gorvine!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course had a lot of writing but I felt it was productive. I learned a lot about writing an APA research paper and Professor Gorvine was super helpful. He is also just very kind and the class is very manageable. The lectures themselves were not always the most engaging, but overall a solid way to take research methods."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely take this class with Gorvine, he is literally amazing and so nice. He's always available to help and so understanding and supportive of students. The course material is definitely not the most interesting and lectures could be somewhat dry because of that, but Gorvine does his best to make it not as boring. A lot of in class group work and we also had a group project for the final paper, but those weren't too bad. Class also had a couple of short papers and a midterm. A whole lot of writing which can be a pain, but Gorvine gives really detailed rubrics that tell you exactly what you need to write so not too terrible!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Ok. Grading was originally 2 short writing assignments (5% each), Research Report 1 (5%), Research Report 2 (15%), Research Report 3 (25%), Exam 1 (20%), Exam 2 (20%) and Peer evaluation (5%). Writing assignments were easy. Research reports not too difficult but you end up spending a lot of time making sure everything is APA format so can be time consuming. Exams were take home and gave 6 question options that we had to choose 2 from. Prof cancelled second exam to give us more time to focus on Reserach Report 3 which was very nice. Redistributed second exam points across other assignments so grading scale changed slightly from what I put above. Peer evaluation is for 3rd research report because you are put in groups to do it. Gorvine is very nice guy. Class is a bit boring but he grades fairly and is very willing to help if you need."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Okay, obviously this is the most dreaded course by psych majors/minors, but if you must take it (do not take this for a distro!) take it with Professor Gorvine!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gorvine is seriously one of the most smartest and kindest teachers I have had. The time and energy that he put into this class, office hours, and grading our assignments is truly unparalleled."
,,,,,,,,,,,"He made this class as bearable as possible, spent hours cleaning through our survey data, and was ALWAYS available for office hours."
,,,,,,,,,,,Gorvine is great. He consistently goes above and beyond for every student and every lesson. This class is a requirement but he makes it bearable and doing the whole research process is very instructive.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class with Professor Gorvine. You hear a lot of bad things about having to take research methods, but Professor Gorvine made the class interesting, manageable and fun!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gorvine is great... but this research methods in psych class definitely had a heavier workload than many of the other sections. That said, prof Gorvine made every class engaging and interesting and it did feel like all of our assignments were relevant. Just know that you will have major writing assignments almost weekly."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class with Gorvine!! He is so thoughtful and really wants to help you learn in this class. The lectures are definitely not the most interesting since the course material is pretty dry in general, but the workload is extremely manageable with the way Gorvine designed the syllabus. Your smaller assignments are first, and you build as you learn more techniques. This was really helpful since it prevents you from getting overwhelmed early on in the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Gorvine is a wonderful teacher who is more than willing to help with anything you need from him. The course is 8–10 writing assignments, some of which have a study construction component. It isn't overwhelming if you start the papers as soon as they're assigned."
,,,,,,,,,,,kinda a tough class to get through but Gorvine was great and made it as good as possible
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gorvine is a great professor. Research methods is not the most interesting subject, but he makes it as interactive as possible with lots of opportunity to discuss and work in groups. It's a pretty big workload but still manageable. Professor is very understanding and flexible."
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS WITH PROF GORVINE! Although this course can be a lot of work, prof Gorvine makes it manageable. He is extremely caring. The research reports take a while to complete but everything else about this class is great. The professor truly made this course for me and is such a gem. He is the best, take it with him! You don't need to do readings and exams are easy."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you have to take this class, take it with Dr. Gorvine"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is a lot of work. Aside from the plentiful smaller writing projects, the research papers take an extremely long time and the third project especially demands a lot of work. That being said, as a major/minor requirement, you can't really avoid it, and Professor Gorvine is the best professor I could have possibly imagined for this course. He understands that it's not the most fun material and tries hard to reduce the workload and make the classes interesting with group discussions, videos, podcasts, snacks, etc. He is so gracious and understanding and incredibly helpful if you ask for his help. Definitely take it with him if you can!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Gorvine is one of the nicest and most helpful professors I've had so far. Lectures are a bit boring, but he is a great professor overall. The research reports are time consuming, but the exams aren't too bad. Only amazing things to say about Gorvine, but this class is definitely a decent amount of work"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this class a lot more than I expected to! The papers were sometimes a lot but they were usually on pretty interesting topics. We ended up only having one take home exam, and other than the papers and exam there wasn't a ton of extra work. Professor Gorvine is an amazing professor and he really cares about students! I enjoyed the style of this class, as it was a good mix of lecture and group work. Honestly I thought this class would be pretty boring, especially as someone who has written a lot of research papers for other classes. However, it was overall a very enjoyable class and I'm really glad I took it with Professor Gorvine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Gorvine was a great professor and incredibly accommodating. He was very easy to listen to even (even when lectures weren’t about the most interesting topics) and made otherwise boring assignments really fun and collaborative. He also really made an effort to get to know each student individually and was always looking for feedback from us on how he could improve. The course load was not too bad either: 3 research papers (all very spread out), two midterms (one of which was cancelled for us, and the other of which was pretty easy: you just had to choose two of 6 short writing prompts to complete), and two short assignments that were also pretty easy. Overall, the class was really fun, not too stressful, and I feel like I learned a lot about research; it was definitely one of the more enjoyable major requirement classes I’ve taken."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is not the most interesting but Professor Gorvine as your teacher made it so much better. You have to take it with him. He is one of the best professors and he cares a lot about the students and is very knowledgeable about the topic. For the class, there's 2 short writing assignments, 3 long reports, and 1 take–home exam."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this course with Professor Gorvine if you can! I had heard some negative things about PSYCH 205 coming into the class, but I found this course super engaging and rewarding. The workload is significant, especially when there is a research report due, but nothing unreasonable. Professor Gorvine is so helpful with everything, which makes completing the big research reports much more manageable."
wnbg,psych,205,winter,Gayathri Subramanian,5.65,4.76,4.94,4.53,5.41,4.65,"The organization of the course could have been better. I did enjoy the collaborative aspect of working in teams on certain assignments and quizzes. The class made me more interested in the research field, but I am unsure how much I actually learned that will stick with me."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was not as hard as people lead it up to be, however, it is still very challenging. You should always keep up on assignments and essays as doing them at the last minute (like I usually do) is not a good idea in this particular course due to it's statistical and data–driven nature. I would say if you take this course, take it with the TA's. Though that might sound daunting, they are sometimes the nicest and best teachers to power through this course with."
,,,,,,,,,,,The most important things to me in this course was learning how to analyze data and incorporate that into a research paper and this class did a pretty good job of teaching that to me. At times I did feel somewhat lost because directions were loose/confusing at times however I was able to figure it out by asking Karen and Gayathri.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think I was not really interested in the course, but Professors Konkoly and Subramanian made the course pretty engaging and fun. I think also they gave a lot of really good feedback on papers which helped with writing. Overall I think writing the psych papers are kind of heinous but that's because the writing is more straightforward and less open–to–interpretation and stylistic than other types of writing, but I think I took the course with the best possible teachers."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course with Gayathri and Karen was really engaging and informative with a collection of class activities to support learning of foundational psychology methods. Sometimes the actual lecturing was repetitive, especially since the content was mostly a summary of assigned readings, but we always had a variety of class activities like weekly group quizzes, outside presenters, and small group discussions so class never felt boring."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Having come into this class with no interest in the subject, I found it doable. Not too much work. Karen and Gayathri are amazing and I could tell they really cared about our learning. I learned a lot about how to write research papers."
,,,,,,,,,,,The content of this course isn't very exciting. It's interesting to get to do your own study but overall it's a pretty dry course. The instructors tried to make it interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was nervous at first, but taking this course with Gayathri and Karen was a really good decision. Since they aren't actually professors, it felt like they were a lot more approachable and worked with the class more to adjust things and figure out the best ways to do certain things. No tests, instead group quizzes which usually went pretty well as long as you had a good group, and 3 papers that got more involved as you went through the course. I felt kind of unprepared for the first paper, like suddenly we just had to write a research paper even though I felt like I didn't really know how to, but I felt much more prepared for the other 2."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was really fun and interesting, especially because of the professors. It solidified my stats knowledge while also helping me learn by creating our own study. The workload is not bad, there are chapter readings for weekly quizzes and then 3 main research reports."
,,,,,,,,,,,Karen and Gayathri were great despite it being their first time teaching a research methods class. They both knew the subject well and were very willing to assist students in and outside of class. Great environment in class and pretty low stakes. This course is a good amount of work but manageable if you don't procrastinate and none of the material is too complex.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I honestly really liked the format, structure, and instruction in this class. With that being said, though, everyone else I talked to about this class didn't nearly enjoy it as much so maybe it's just me. While the straight 'lecture' classes were really boring and uninformative, they were few and far between with most classes involving some sort of activity. The group quizzes were definitely annoying for a variety of reasons, but Gayathri and Karen were extremely enthusiastic and kind professors. The course was never stressful, with deadlines and expectations gradually (and fairly) becoming more strict over time. Non–paper assignments were super easy. Paper grading was extremely fair but also full of feedback. Good class with two lovely professors."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think that our teachers (two grad students) steadily got the hang of how to run a class throughout the quarter. The course started off kind of rough when they could not explain a chi–squared test without thoroughly confusing us all, but everyone started to settle into their roles after the first few weeks. I am confident that they will be great professors one day if they choose that path! The textbook readings were not super useful – might be a waste of time. You will feel so proud of yourself for the research reports you are able to create by the end of the class! Be sure to pick a good group for the final project as you will really need to rely on your teammates to conduct a quality study."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a highlight of my quarter! The two graduate students who taught this course (Gayathri Subramanian and Karen Konkoly) created a great environment where I felt I could safely share my ideas and I looked forward to hearing those of others, as well. The transition from each project from going through the research process with the class as a whole to being in independent groups was very helpful, as well, in helping me feel confident in conducting research. I also loved the guest lectures on different areas of psychology research we had from the instructors' colleagues/peers (as well as from themselves)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was nervous taking this class at first because of how it was being taught by grad students rather than professors, but they did a great job and I think they both would make really talented teachers if they chose to go that route"
,,,,,,,,,,,"was nervous going into class bc i thought it would be hard, but karen and gayathri made it SO much better! loved their teaching style and they reduced the difficulty of this SO much!!! take w karen and gayathri!"
wnbg,psych,205,winter,Ginger Pennington,5.00,4.27,4.20,3.87,4.67,6.19,"If you have to take this class for a major/minor requirement, take it with Prof. Pennington!!! I'm not super into research, especially writing research papers, so I kinda had to drag myself through this class, but Prof. Pennington is extremely engaging and shares funny anecdotes in class, and you can tell that she's actually very passionate about research. There's no exams –– just writing a total of 3 research papers (last one is for a project you design and execute in a group) and occasional Canvas reading quizzes and prep assignments, and grading is pretty fair. Plus, she gives good feedback on reports, and basically does all the hard stuff with data analysis and writing up the ""results"" sections for all of the reports."
,,,,,,,,,,,I don't know anyone who likes research methods but it has to be done for psych but I think there are easier options than to take it with Professor Pennington. Although she cares for her students she can be a little disorganized at times which makes the class frustrating and more difficult than it should be.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is not actually scary. Realistically it is 2 challenging papers, and dealing with a group that most likely will not help you in the slightest. Pennington is entertaining, if slightly unorganized."
,,,,,,,,,,,Boring.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Three research papers, no exams. Pennington is great and very helpful."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this with Prof Pennington, she genuinely wants the paper material to be interesting which makes the process go from extremely painful to bearable. The structure of the class is great and there's not too much work outside of the papers, she adjusts the weekly prep questions and quizzes to not overlap when there are papers due and as the quarter goes on we barely had any (it was great). There were no exams which was really helpful to balance the workload with the papers, which took up a lot of time. Would highly recommend going to office hours/getting feedback on the papers before submitting (she builds this into assignments) because it makes it much easier to get a better grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class definitely was not as bad as everyone said it was and I definitely found the course material to be more interesting than I expected. Pennington is super nice and helpful and not a super hard grader, so take this class with her!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is one of the requirements for the Psych major, so I had to take it. I'm glad I took with Professor Pennington since she was flexible with the schedule when needed and she provided a lot of support! Our grade consisted of 3 papers, learning quizzes, and prep assignments based on readings, which is a better distribution of assignments than other Psych 205 classes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It definitely wasn’t as bad as I was expecting, as I was very much dreading this course. There are no tests, but there are many small deadlines to keep track of – quizzies, prep questions, and report drafts – throughout the week. There are three research papers, with very specific guidelines, but the professor is very thorough in her teaching and willing to help outside of the classroom as well. She offers very quality feedback after each paper and grades very generously. Although I never want to write another research paper again, the class is definitely doable with Ginger."
,,,,,,,,,,,Take research methods with pennington!! Shes amazing and it is so much more easy grading and engaging than other professors
,,,,,,,,,,,The class had 3 research reports and we were also supposed to have weekly quizzes but we only had them assigned to us a couple of times. Prof. Pennington was really nice but the class was unstructured which made assignments and deadlines confusing.
wnbg,psych,205,winter,Harry David Smith,4.26,3.16,3.53,4.00,3.42,5.77,"I would not choose to take this class with this professor if I did not have to. Assignments and expectations are not made clear yet you are graded as if they are. He is a nice man, but the amount of work compared to all other research methods courses taught by other professors in addition to the lack of the direction in this class was baffling."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course should not be taken UNLESS you're 100000% sure you want a psych major/ minor. While HDS tries his best to be helpful to students (he is always open to meeting one–on–one), it is hard if you do not have experience in data analysis/ writing research papers. The topics are pretty straightforward, too straightforward that it gets boring at most times– this doesn't mean it is super easy."
,,,,,,,,,,,"take this course with HDS if you cannot get into one of the other easier professor's courses. this class had 2 exams and 3 research papers. the exams were easier than the papers and are a larger percentage of your grade which is nice, but still annoying since other classes did not have tests. the papers are difficult and you need to meet with the TA or professor to do well. HDS is so nice and cares about his students. definitely recommend if you want to take an easier section of this course, but i would try to get into a class that does not have exams first."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The material of this course was not the most interesting to me, especially since I took the same course at my old school (not sure why NU doesn't give credit for this). However, this was my favorite class just because of professor Smith (or HDS). He is genuinely one of the best professors I have ever had. I can't even count how many times he has set up a Zoom meeting with me the same day I emailed him with questions. He went out of his way and spent so much time analyzing the data for us when he didn't have to. He knows that some of the material is not interesting and can be confusing, but he will reframe the way he asks questions in class and is responsive to us. I have asked him to be my advisor for my senior honors thesis; that should show you how great of a professor he is."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this course, but Professor Smith assigned a significantly greater amount of work and assignments than the other professors teaching Research Methods. Though this did challenge me and force me to truly understand the content, it was a bit exhausting at times. I still actually ended up really enjoying the course, though!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"He doesn't post lectures, which was quite annoying. Also, grading criteria was poorly defined, but was super strict? Class didn't seem too structured, either."
,,,,,,,,,,,"HDS is a nice professor but a dull lecturer. People rarely pay attention. There were also 3 papers, and 2 exams which was a lot. The final paper and exam were extremely overwhelming at the end of the quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Love the prof, he's a great guy who really cares about his students. Had him for psych stats too and I love him. He goes out of his way to help anyone who needs it. I really was not looking forward to this course because I passionately dislike stats but it was mainly writing research papers and learning about research and he makes the stats part of the analysis very comprehensible and he will absolutely help. So overall, not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Def not my favorite class ever but for it being a requirement for psych I was happier than I thought."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was kind of annoying in that the workload with exams and essays was a lot at times. It is doable but I feel that some of the things expected of us for essays were not made clear/explained well in class. It was overall pretty confusing as to what the expectations were.
,,,,,,,,,,,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROF SMITH. He is a nice person but not a great professor. He is incredibly disorganized with his class materials––the Canvas page was always a mess. Our deadlines were always so rushed with each paper, and this is one of the only classes with actual exams, along with three other papers. During our finals week, we had a big paper and a final, preventing all of us from studying for other classes. He is super unclear with his instruction. You never know what he is looking for, even though he claims to have said things in class. You can get points docked off for the most random things because you didn't know that was something he wanted. There were no rubrics for each paper, so all of us were just blindly writing. He didn't teach us how to write parts of the research paper and then graded us harshly for the first one when none of us had written a research paper before. He is very unresponsive to the TA's advice, especially when she was helping students share their opinions or requests for the class. His class also has no focus whatsoever. I learned everything but at the same time, nothing at all. I could not tell you a single thing that I learned from this class. It was incredibly time–consuming and stressful taking this with Prof. Smith, and the rest of the class would agree. Avoid taking it with HDS, and your life will be a lot easier."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was rougher than I thought it would be. Prof Smith is a great guy–– super sweet, always open to meet with students 1:1, and seems super excited about teaching this course. However, the content was confusing and the assignments were a bit of a mess. I remember getting my grade back for my first research paper in this class and being completely blindsided. The papers don't have clear rubrics, and the way our TA graded them seemed unfairly harsh. I know a number of people in the class dropped after that first grade was released, and I don't blame them. Our class also had a midterm and final exam in addition to the three research papers, which I've heard that other Psych 205 classes don't include. Work became pretty overwhelming when it came time for the second and third research projects/papers. You have to coordinate with your group, put together Qualtrics surveys, distribute the surveys, analyze the data (which we couldn't do on our own because the computers in Tech don't have access to SPSS), find primary sources, and create figures, all before you even start writing the paper. Even after all of that, when you've already put probably ~10 hours of work into your project before writing the paper, your paper will be graded extremely harshly and you'll be given a vague study guide for the midterm and final. The last project in particular was extremely confusing–– it felt like the professor and the TA were not on the same terms at all in regards to what was expected, even for basic steps like the structure of our studies. This course was definitely the most frustrating one I've taken this quarter, if not in my entire time at NU so far."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class was okay overall, but the only downside was that the professor's instructions about the research papers were always very vague. That said, the projects we worked on were fun. You can literally choose any topic you want for your projects, so it makes the work much more enjoyable. – The required assignments for this class include 3 research papers, a midterm exam, and a final exam."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you can, take this with a different professor. Smith is a really nice guy and will help you if you go talk to him, but his class has exams plus more work you need to doo for projects and papers than the other instructors' classes (the ones I've heard of don't have exams at all). It's not a hard class, so if you don't have a busy quarter it will be fine to spend extra time on this than you would with other professors"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is not the most fun course but a major requirement. 2 team research projects which are fairly tedious and difficult. Professor Smith is very sweet, thoughtful, and helpful – the curriculum is just not the most engaging"

,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was harder than anticipated. The tests seem straightforward but have tricky wording and harsh grading. The papers are long and boring, but not terribly difficult. Stay on top of your work and don't be afraid to ask questions."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's a required course, and people are right, it's boring and not incredibly helpful. The third research paper where you get to do your own research is fun, but in general, the papers are cumbersome. It's not hard to do well in this course, it's hard to stay motivated because the course is just incredibly boring and redundant with research you've likely learned how to do in other courses."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not an easy class. If you have had research experience prior to this class it's probably not that bad, but as someone who had never written any sort of academic paper, it was definitely a challenge. Great course though, I learned so much. Prof. Horton is super helpful though!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a decent amount of work; there are weekly homework assignments along with two exams and three papers.

,,,,,,,,,,,"This class isn't as exciting as others, but Horton does a good job of making the topic interesting. Solid amount of work, but you just have to get through it."

I understand the tests and the papers, but would have appreciated if the assignments were due every other week – just felt like overkill. The class is definitely bearable and Professor Horton is super responsive and helpful with all questions. He was very supportive in the data collection part of Paper #3 and I appreciated that."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Nobody really wants to take this class, but if you have to, take it with Horton! He definitely wants everyone to succeed, and all of the assignments/tests were very reasonable. Super nice and recognizes that this is not a thrilling class but does his best to make it enjoyable!"
,,,,,,,,,,,not great. Pretty tough and not easy to study for. Only thing i can think of is to make sure youre able to give a ted talk on every concept you talk about and if you cant do that you better pray you get a good ta.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Horton makes this course engaging and the slides are really useful. This course helps you gain practice in writing and research papers. The workload is also very manageable, as there are only weekly assignments that help you apply what you're learning to a case study. The exams are not too difficult as well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was ok. I learned so much, but it was a LOT of work. 3 papers (the first one is really easy) and 2 exams, and 7 weekly assignments. This is expected from research methods though."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Exams are harder than you'll expect, but super manageable with proper studying. Horton is a solid professor who explains content clearly and is eager to meet with students outside of class time. Some people say this class feels like busy–work but I felt that if you choose paper topics you're interested in, it's very gratifying! Horton also is really encouraging with the feedback he gives too!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Horton is great. Kind, and available to meet about any issues or trouble you might be having in the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Content is boring, but you already knew that."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Horton has quite a bit of workload, I think compared to some other sections of Psych 205, but I think it was manageable, and he provides a lot of guidance on how to do okay or even well in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,the combination of reports and tests were good to ensure that the material was learned well
,,,,,,,,,,,"Just like you will hear from any other Psych 205 CTEC, this class is not your walk–in–the–park A psychology class, and definitely not the most interesting. You WILL have to work for an A, but it is definitely possible. Points come from a lot of different areas in this class: participation (individual and group), 2 non–cumulative exams, 3 papers each with increasing weight. Professor Horton is a little bit of a strict grader with papers, but other than that, he does want his students to succeed and I've heard that compared to other Psych 205 professors, Professor Horton makes this one easier and as enjoyable as is possible."

,,,,,,,,,,,"Ok, first let me start off by saying that Jose and Sean were the ABSOLUTE BEST instructors for this course, and EVERY criticism I have has absolutely NOTHING to do with them. They bent over backwards to help me, they gave our class literally every opportunity possible to succeed, and they literally would read your papers before you submitted them to ensure you were on the right track. I LOVED Sean and Jose and if they ever teach this class again PLEASE take it with them. However, this class itself was kinda a dumpster fire. The goal of this course is to teach us how to write psych papers, yet most of the material was a simple review of 201 and bits and pieces of info from 110. There’s so much busy work that Sean and Jose literally told us they were being forced to implement that was completely unnecessary– honestly it was really hard to keep track of everything we had to submit in a given week. The papers and projects themselves… well, let’s just say the main difficulty of writing the papers was actually justifying why they were a decent, well constructed, relevant study. Overall, I actually learned a lot, but the only reason why is because Sean and Jose‘s feedback on my writing and the countless hours we spent talking about random stuff in office hours. Truly I love these guys, but PSYCH 205 as a class is truly unnecessary."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall a pretty good course. Def take research methods with grad studetns because they're honestly pretty good professors. Occasionally there were times were things could've been taught better, but if you've taken both Psych 110 and Psych 201 or have a background in what good research looks like, this class is a pretty easy A."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great class, the way it was structured made it easy to learn and build as you go. You will gain valuable knowledge behind psych research in general as well as experience working with a group on a project you craft together. The quizzes were not complicated, just good check–ins that will be a breeze if you attend class and pay attention."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's Research Methods. Nothing particularly exciting or special, just the usual psych prereq. The material was fairly dry but not particularly difficult (expected) and assessment expectations were more or less reasonable. I didn't look forward to this class by any means, but I didn't dread it as much as some others have in different 205 sections. It's nice to take this class with TAs though, they're generally very understanding."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think this class was a little bit more uninteresting, especially for someone who doesn't plan to do psychology research. It was a very ""How to..."" kinda class. However, the Graduate teachers were extremely nice and enthusiastic. I think in this class it helps to look at the slides and notes are useful. With the essays, you should definitely start early since there is a lot of write ways to do things."
,,,,,,,,,,,Don’t take this class unless you have to. Grading is arbitrary and the only reason you would have to show up to lectures is because they take attendance.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I feel like the only reason I did well in this class was because it was taught by two TAs and they didn't grade harsh. The analyzing data part was a bit challenging but after you figure out the formula to write the papers, you are pretty much set."
,,,,,,,,,,,A lot of busy work
wnbg,psych,205,spring,Casey Riedmann,5.52,4.45,4.76,4.14,4.81,6.24,It is required for PSYCH major and minor and good at teaching you general outlook and outline of a psych research paper.
,,,,,,,,,,,Casey is extremely nice and accommodating to everyone. Slides he used made is possible to just learn from the lectures and not read the textbook. Reports were graded very harshly and strictly – somewhat arbitrary what they wanted.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Riedmann knows the content really well and generally encourages class participation, considering the subject itself is a fairly boring. straightforward course. a /ton/ of work, but you have to get through it for major requirements. if you don't have a decent base understanding of structuring a research paper and how research methods work, it'll probably be pretty hard to get through the first half."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very easy to course. You do not need the textbook (dependent on the instructor but for the most part, you don't need it). Literally just show up to class do the assignment and you'll be good."
,,,,,,,,,,,Casey was great even though the themes of this class are admittedly kind of boring. It was a manageable class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is mandated cause nobody would choose to do this content on their own. That said, it's really not that hard to get through if you can write and edit a decent paper."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was pretty straightforward and not to difficult.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was prepared to hate this class based on past CTECs, but taking it with Riedmann really was great! He simplified everything as much as possible, and genuinely as long as you paid attention and put forth some effort, the class was really manageable. There were a lot of assignments (3 quizzes, 3 short assignments, 3 reports, final presentation), so the class is more of a time commitment than anything. There were lots of extra credit too!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a tough class for me but regardless, I still really appreciated Casey as a teacher. I think he made a class that would otherwise be super boring kind of fun and he was always super helpful. The grading for this class was hard but not unfair, just have to put in the work."
,,,,,,,,,,,I dont think this class was as bad as people put it out to be. Writing reports was super tedious and unpleasant but its very formulaic. I think Casey Riedmann did a fantastic job in being super helpful with students and their reports though I do not think that his lecture style was very engaging.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was one of those classes you simply must get through. It's not always pretty and the material itself can be a little dry, but you learn important information on research, regardless of whether you intend to carry on with a psychology degree. Casey was pretty good as a lecturer and really did his best to make the content digestible and applicable. The in–class quizzes (each having 10 MCQs only) were pretty straightforward if you review the lecture slides prior to class, but the 3 reports do require some time and effort to get a good grade on them. A word of advice on the reports: they took much longer than I anticipated, so you need to START EARLY! If you'd like, work on one section at a time, and ask the instructor or TA for feedback/help along the way."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is essentially the foundation for all upper–level research in psychology since it basically teaches you how to write papers and conduct research alongside them. The majority of the work for this class was writing reports– there were 3 in total throughout the quarter– but there were short assignments and quizzes scattered throughout. The workload could definitely build up and get overwhelming at a certain point, but both the instructor and the TA were easy to work with."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Although I was not interested in Research Methods in Psychology, I learned a lot from class lectures and got good feedback after each short assignment and report. The quizzes were fair as they only tested us on what we talked about in class, and the workload was not as bad as I expected."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There were 3 reports, 3 assignments, and 3 quizzes, not a lot of work that couldn’t be done as long as one attended class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a good class and you get super good at essay writing because of the amount of practice. With that, it is a lot of work."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is definitely a mixed bag depending on who's teaching it, but i didn't think it was too bad. Content was a little dull, but necessary nonetheless."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Do not take this class if you don't need to. The professor did his best to make it interesting but even he could tell that no one wanted to be there. Like overall not that terrible, but not worth it unless its a requirement."
wnbg,psych,205,spring,Almaz Mesghina,6.00,5.70,5.45,5.05,5.75,5.65,"Professor Mesghina is the most AMAZING professor! If you can take this course with her, you definitely should. She is a fair grader, but challenges her students to do their best work. I'm a psych major, and learned so much from her class that I will be able to apply to my work in the future. LOVED THIS CLASS!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Mesghina is great! I wasn't particularly interested in taking this course, but she structured it in a way that made it enjoyable and interesting. I learned a lot and certainly gained a better understanding of how to conduct research."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class! Professor Mesghina is very nice.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Mesghina literally changes the game for 205. I have been dreading this course since I declared my psych major, and truly this course was so manageable and fun because of Prof. Mesghina. I wouldn’t take 205 unless you can take it with her!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm not going to lie everybody dreads taking this course as you can tell from past CTECs, but Professor Mesghina makes this course not just bearable, but fun! The course is group based and you write 2 mini papers along with a final paper that you have roughly 5 weeks to work on. Professor Mesghina makes the writing process super smooth and is always willing to look over the paper and give thoughtful comments on how to improve. Professor Mesghina was never unfair when it came to comments about our papers or our grades, and in my opinion is probably one of the better professors Northwestern has! if you have to take this course definitely take it with Professor Mesghina."
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE IT WITH PROF MESGHINA!! Everyone warns you this class is bad but with her it really wasn't. She made expectations really clear, provides a LOT of helpful feedback and gives you plenty of chances to implement that feedback. She gave no tests, gives time in class to work on our projects, and groups us based on shared interests which meant we all got to research things we were actually interested in. She is also just really approachable, easy to talk to, and explains things really clearly (I'm taking another class with her next quarter I love her so much)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was wonderful, the prof really emphasized learning about research not only to be a researcher as a future career but also as a general topic of interest to others. I enjoyed the leveled structure of the class to engage in different parts of research, slowly building up skills and confidence to do a full research project as a group."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a class that you need to do for the psych major/minor, and people say it's super boring. It's definitely not the most interesting class ever, but prof Mesghina is AMAZING!!!! Absolutely take this class with her. She's enthusiastic, easy to talk to, and genuinely cares about the success of her students. It's not the greatest course, but Mesghina makes it amazing. I ended up having a great time in this class, which was super unexpected."
,,,,,,,,,,,Mesghina slays. Like the most down to earth prof ever. Super understanding of extenuating circumstances and is willing to push back deadlines if she didn't get through slides quick enough. Also she is great tabour letting you learn from her peers instead of listening to a lecture the whole time. Class is essentially entirely group work so quite manageable if you have a good group. No tests which was amazing and I have a new appreciation for reading research. Def brush up your statistics knowledge tho.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Excellent course and professor. Everything was very clear in terms of expectations and assignments. There were specific rubrics, consistent feedback, and an overall well designed course structure. Strongly suggest taking this class with Mesghina."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Mesghina is the best! This class is a major/minor requirement for most students but she made the course super interesting and I enjoyed going to class and working with my group. Even if you don't plan on going into research she makes the course super accessible and approachable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Psych 205 can feel like a necessary evil (at least it did to me before taking it) but with prof mesghina, it was really really enjoyable and I actually had a lot of fun in it. You're able to conduct a study in a field of psychology that actually interests you, which was really nice"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot about what it takes to do research and craft a research paper. I really enjoyed this class! Professor Mesghina made this class fun and informative, and she always made sure to check in with the class or extend due dates if necessary."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Mesghina is great, she's so funny and the classes are never boring. I have heard that this section is more work than the section with Greg Miller, but honestly Prof. Mesghina made it worth it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Considering this a class meant to help teach you how to collect/analyze data and write a research paper, it wasn't always super interesting, but Professor Mesghina was a great teacher and made the class as interesting as possible. Both the professor and TA were extremely helpful and provided a lot of great feedback on every assignment and answered questions very clearly. Initially, the speed of writing the first research paper feels quick, but keeping that in mind, the professor and TA graded very fairly. Once we got to the second and main research paper, things slowed down a lot and we got into more detail about things. You'll be in the same group for the whole quarter, so everything is very collaborative in this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Three papers overal, 2 presentations.. most of the class is just writing groups papers"
wnbg,psych,205,spring,Greg Miller,5.06,4.40,4.56,4.56,4.18,5.12,"While the professor is very kind, I found this class to be extremely disorganized. Throughout the course, I often felt overwhelmed because the material was not presented in a beginner–friendly manner. Many of us were constantly confused about how to approach the research papers. The first paper went fine, but the second and final papers required me to spend long periods of time in office hours seeking clarification. Additionally, the TA graded assignments harshly; however, I did learn from their feedback. I sympathize with the TA as they bore the burden of helping us due to the professor's inadequate presentation of the material. There is definitely room for improvement in how the material is delivered."
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS WITH DR. GREG MILLER. HE IS AMAZING. I was so intimidated about taking this class because of the horror stories I had heard about it, but Prof Miller is seriously the best professor I could've asked for in this class. He is super approachable and really cares about his students. He even brought us cookies each class period when we were working on our final papers. He even met with my group on an extra day when he didn't have to to help us with our data analysis. I seriously can't say enough good things about him. The papers are definitely a lot of work and they're all individual except the final paper, but you get a lot of feedback throughout which is really nice."
,,,,,,,,,,,Hard course. The papers take a lot of time to finish.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Miller is super accommodating and makes this class feel less daunting. He's so friendly and eager to help, so definitely take this class with him!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a solid class. It was a great experience to conduct my own research project at the end of the quarter.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I found that this course with Professor Miller was not as bad as I thought Research Methods would be. Your grade is based on 3 papers (with the last paper being on a study you create with a partner) but I felt like this was easy to manage. Most of the grading is based on your technical writing skills and I felt like I did somewhat improve on that towards the end of the course. I feel like I would have appreciated a bit more time to work on the last paper but besides that, Professor Miller was really nice and pretty helpful especially in planning your own research study!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is fine, but don't take it unless you have to. Prof Miller is nice. The class felt very disorganized."
,,,,,,,,,,,The class was very informative in terms of how to conduct research and write a research paper.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is super boring and not very engaging. We wasted the last three weeks of the course just ""collecting data"" for the papers, which meant that you couldn't write a majority of your paper until a few days before it was due. I feel like the way we used class wasn't very effective and I didn't like how the first few papers were complicated studies where the literature didn't really make sense. You also only get about a week to write the first two papers, which sucks because they're due during midterm weeks when you're typically very busy. I would recommend going to TA office hours because she's the one who grades each assignment. She's really helpful and I did much better on the papers when I consulted with her first."
,,,,,,,,,,,take this section! Prof. Miller and Dani are the BEST!
,,,,,,,,,,,"You kind of just have to take this class. It's not super fun, and the material is very technical. The TA I had for this class very very picky when grading out essays and I really had a hard time working with her. Miller is a great prof for this class however, really kind and caring and he organizes this class to allow you to use class time and your classmates for your experiment which was super helpful."

wnbg,psych,212,spring,Robin Nusslock,5.81,5.49,5.57,5.14,5.70,3.96,prof is very passionate about neuroscience
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a lot less scary than it looks! Just don’t be scared of taking it, Prof Nusslock is amazing and super engaging. Just make sure you are good at memorizing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There were 2 exams, a midterm and a final. Weekly readings from the textbook, but mostly just needed to study the slides, though there were always a few questions you could only answer with the readings. Tests were straightforward but you need to study. Multiple choice and essay questions."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really recommend this course, especially for Basic Science req! Prof. Nusslock really wants you to do well in this course and is open to all questions during class. Class is structured with 2 exams and 3 small writing assignments about a topic of your choosing in neuroscience."
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof. Nusslock really cares about his students and tries his best to ensure everyone understands the material.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would highly recommend this course. It helped that I had some background in neuroscience from taking different psych classes, but even if I didn't I thought Prof. Nusslock presented the information in a very clear way. Definitely made me more interested in neuroscience. The workload is definitely manageable but you still learn a lot. You can tell Prof. Nusslock really cares about the topics and tries to teach in a very accessible way."
,,,,,,,,,,,being in class was most important to best understand all concepts. the slides are helpful if you miss class but really don't capture everything you need to know
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good class! Prof Nusslock clearly outlines what he wants you to know for exams and does a great job explaining in lectures. It is a little scary that the exams are worth 40 and 45% of the grade, but they are thankfully fair and mostly based on class slides. You do learn a lot about diff topics in neuroscience, from action potentials to the functions of sleep and theories of consciousness. Prof nusslock is very knowledgeable and holds multiple review sessions to help students!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Very interesting class and lecture
,,,,,,,,,,,You do not need to read or even purchase the textbook. Only 2/50 MC questions on the exams are based on the textbook. There was very little outside work for the class aside from 2 short writing assignments and 2 exams.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought the exams were very fair, and even though the lectures can be dense sometimes, Professor Nusslock is pretty great at answering questions and clarifying confusing concepts. He's very helpful in that."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Nusslock is a wonderful professor. I was a little nervous going into this class because I do not have an extensive biology background, but he made the content so easy to digest and understand. The class definitely deals with difficult topics but Prof. Nusslock did an excellent job at teaching it. As a third–year psychology major, I can easily say that this was my favorite (and also just extremely relevant) class in the Psychology department that I have taken at Northwestern. I highly recommend this course!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definetly take this class if you need a psych class, a natural science distro, or have any interest whatsoever in neuroscience. You don't need to read the textbook, just STUDY THE SLIDES. There are two exams and a few writing assignments that are meant as a grade–booster. You need to make sure you study hard for the exams, because they ask really specific questions and you essentially need to know all the information on all the slides. But literally the only work you have to do is study before the exams, so I highly recommend. Robin is also a really good lecturer."
,,,,,,,,,,,"What a fantastic class. I was admittedly intimidated by the course title (I knew nothing about neuroscience beforehand) but Professor Nusslock is a wonderful, organized, and knowledgable lecturer. Each class was significantly engaging and topics were explained clearly and in multiple ways. The sure way to succeed is to attend class and play close attention to the lectures. Exams are INCREDIBLY FAIR. I spent about 2–3 days studying before exams and felt confident and scored well. The textbook is super supplementary and not entirely necessary, but if you need another mode to digest a topic it's a great resource. The 3 short papers dispersed throughout the quarter were easy and fun. You're essentially asked to find a neuroscience article that interests you and summarize it (it's graded out of 5 points). HIGHLY recommend this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,really interesting class with a great professor. i took it for a major requirement and found the tests difficult – only two exams that are 40% and 45% of your grade with multiple choice and short answer questions. a lot of memorization and not a very easy distribution requirement. i would only take if you need this for your major because it is very interesting but not as easy as everyone says.
,,,,,,,,,,,"As an engineering student, this has been one of my favorite classes outside McCormick. The professor is a great lecturer. You can tell how much he cares about the subject. I never thought neuro would be that interesting, but I learned so much! Take this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very comprehensive class. If you have no bio background it’ll be a bit difficult, if you’ve taken any bio/anatomy class this will mostly be review (a lot of it repeats PSYCH 110/ap psych)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great course –– incredibly interesting –– but definitely not an easy A if that is what you are looking for. As a typically A–earning student at NU, I struggled at times keeping up with content because the class can move fast at times, but in retrospect, I learned a lot, and that is outweighed by a GPA."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you don't take this class, you are doing yourself an unbelievable disservice. I can't even describe how great it is. Professor Nusslock is absolutely phenomenal and you'll just have to see his knowledge for yourself. Writing assignments are fine, exams relatively easy. TAKE THIS FOR A NATURAL SCIENCE DISTRO! You won't regret it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a good class. Definitely harder than most natural science distros, but thought it was really pertinent to my Cog Sci major. The professor is great and clearly cares about his students. The whole grade is basically made up of two exams which is stressful, but they were manageable and fair. It is definitely possible to do well in this class and someone with no science background."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Nusslock is a great professor – highly recommend taking this class with him if you have the chance. He is very passionate about course content, and is a very engaging lecturer. Overall, I really enjoyed this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a good course, and Professor Nusslock is really a good guy. He is passionate and understanding!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is formatted with three papers that are more than doable, a midterm, and a final. You'll do good on the exams if you attend lecture and review the slides. Ask for help when you need it too!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is fascinating, the professor is amazing, and the TAs were also super helpful! The presentation slides are extremely clear and are uploaded to Canvas. If, for some reason, you can't attend class, it's like you still went because all the information is still accessible. There are 3 quick 1–2 page assignments throughout the quarter, but they are extremely easy. There is also one midterm and one non–cumulative final exam with an extra credit question on each. As someone who didn't go to class and just memorized the slides while skimming the additional readings for extra bits of information, I passed with an easy A. Stress–free course with an amazing professor who actually conveys information in a way that you learn a lot, what could be better!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Nusslock is amazing. He is clearly very passionate about neuroscience and making sure we learn. He hosted an in–person review session for 2 hours before the final at like 8–10pm and answers copious questions that we all had. Haven't taken the final yet but I wouldn't say this class is super difficult, the midterm, which is around 40% of our grade, had an average of 94.9% and a median of 98.6%, although I think that is higher than some previous years. There are also little writing assignments throughout for 15% of the grade that are just exploring whatever topic you want, and they are usually pretty lenient."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this course thoroughly. To do well in this class, you have to memorize the slides for the exams!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Nusslock is a fantastic lecturer and is the reason why I'm switching my major to neuroscience. Although I was pretty interested in the topics covered in this course, his teaching style is enthusiastic, engaging, and very straightforward. You have to write 3 short reflection papers (2 pages double–spaced) and there are 2 noncumulative exams. You really only need to study the slides in order to do well on the exams, but I highly recommend going to Nusslock's lectures and review sessions (which are a day or two before each exam) because he explains the content in a way that is easy to digest."
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof Nusslock is the most wonderful professor. Every lecture I was so impressed by his intelligence and eloquence. He is so kind and approachable and a great lecturer and person!
,,,,,,,,,,,robin is so awesome. one of my favorite professors –– super kind and accomodating and wants to see his students succeed!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Interesting class! Only 2 tests meaning the final is 45% of your grade, 3 very short papers. There ends up being a lot of material that you're responsible to know but if you're interested in neuro this is a good class to take!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Nusslock is a great lecturer!! He doesn't record the lectures so you need to attend class but he makes it pretty interesting so its worth it. You dont NEED to read the textbook because there are only 1–2 questions from it on each exam. You definitely need to study before the exams (there are 2, noncumulative) but if you memorize the slides you can do well. I recommend!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES I'VE TAKEN AT NU!!! Professor Nusslock is AMAZING. He did a great job taking really complex topics and making them accessible to everyone. I learned so so so much and have a much greater appreciation of the brain. Your grade is made of two exams (midterm is 40% of grade, final is 45%) and three short outside media/research assignments (5% each). Don't let the high percentages of the exams scare you, if you just pay attention in class and memorize the slides you will be more than fine. There were readings assigned that corresponded with lectures but tbh I never did a single reading and was never lost in the class and still did very well. I loved this course and wish I could take a million more with Professor Nusslock."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class. In addition to lectures, there were three short writing assignments and two exams, so the workload was super manageable. I think for those majoring in psychology, this is a really good introduction to how the brain works, and I've found myself looking at psychology really differently after taking this class. Professor Nusslock is an incredible professor. It was very clear that he cared about our success, and was not only very helpful asking question in lecture but also was great in office hours, where he was a wealth of knowledge. He held review session the night before each exam as well which was much appreciated. I would definitely recommend this class as a column B for psych majors, or for any other major in which an understanding of the brain would be beneficial."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course, and Professor Nusslock is one of the most passionate professors I have ever had! He is insanely knowledgeable and answers all students' questions during class to the best of his ability. I also learned a lot about myself and how I think during this course. I would highly recommend it!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was extremely interesting and challenged me in an educational way.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Nusslock is a wonderful professor and this has been one of my favorite classes at NU thus far. Grade is based on 3 written assignments, 1 midterm, and 1 final. The writing assignments are only worth 5 points and are only two pages long so it's very doable. There's a lot of content, but the exams are fair and match what are on the slides. The average on the midterm was an A– so it's not super stressful as long as you review all the content. Lectures can be long, but Nusslock is an engaging presenter and stops for questions frequently. It's clear Nusslock is very passionate about the course and his energy is so wholesome."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Robin is such a fantastic, passionate and kind lecturer. He does he best to keep students engaged and is very knowledgeable. As long as you study the slides, you will be prepared for the exams. Also 3 mini and very manageable papers which are graded leniently."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course. I did not really know what I was getting into prior to it but it did not disappoint. It made me want to be a psych major and even consider going deeper into Neuroscience. The 3 papers are easy and the exams are fair. The professor is amazing, I will try to take any classes with him. He really cares about making it understandable and gets that not everyone is a science genius."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Nusslock is amazing.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really really loved this class, and I think it was because of Robin. He was an amazing lecturer, funny, and helped stimulate my interest in some more nitty–gritty topics like the anatomy of an action potential. Really recommend this class to anyone who is even remotely interested."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There isn't a lot of work to do outside of class, but that means the large majority of your grade depends on two exams. The exams are fair, though, and the lecture slides are well organized and clear, so they're helpful for studying"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course moves really fast and there's a lot of material that's covered on the second exam. As someone who isn't as great with memorization or biology, I did find it to be difficult at times. I didn't have as much time as I wanted to study, but if you read the textbook and review the powerpoints you should be fine. Professor Nusslock is a really engaging lecturer and the material he covered is very interesting. If you're a psych major, there are definitely easier major requirement courses that you could take, but I don't regret taking this one despite the challenge."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There were three small written assignments, one midterm, and one non–cumulative final. The lectures were not the most engaging, but the professor was very kind and passionate about the subject. It wasn't as bad as I was expecting, so I would recommend for a Column B !"
,,,,,,,,,,,really good for psych majors scared of neuro. not intimidating and generally not too hard
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Nusslock is such a great lecturer! He has so much passion for the topics in this class, and he answers students questions in a really clear and engaging way with a lot of humility. I liked how there was a balance of the biology and psychology side of neuroscience. Sometimes, the lecture content can get a bit dense. Reviewing the lecture slides was really helpful for me. The exams were not too difficult – mostly just understanding and memorizing the lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a surprisingly easy and enjoyable class. Dr. Nusslock is one of the best teachers I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. He does get a little carried away with neuro jargon (which is honestly inevitable in any field), but he generally does a great job of making complicated concepts more digestible through simple terms, succinct descriptions and helpful analogies. We didn't have a single dry lecture, and he was extremely organized in the way he approached the course. He also celebrated former students who had said in their CTECs that you could pass without the textbook (this was my experience also), which I thought was a great testament to his genuine commitment to making his lectures and slides as accessible as possible. We had 4 short writing assignments (basically finding a neuro article/paper and relating it to the class), one midterm and one final which were both non–cumulative. The lectures are fun and great for synthesizing the material, but if you have to miss a class, you can catch up pretty well using the slides and do well on the exams. He is also genuinely excited about neuroscience, and he visibly brightens up when you approach him with a question or comment, whether in or outside of class. The only negative thing I got from this class was the sadness I felt when I realized how much better my life would have been if I had had someone like him teach me middle school science or high school biology. I'm an international student who had to take the 3 sciences all 4 years of high school, and I had very punitive instructors who publicly humiliated students when they didn't understand course concepts. Getting hit and publicly mocked dampened my experience, and I decided I would never be smart enough for the hard sciences. Despite being a cognitive science major, I've avoided STEM–heavy classes and was scared to take this one for my theme requirement. But I'm extremely glad I did. I'm going to be a senior, so it's too late to declare a second minor, but I at least have enough confidence now that I can see myself tuning in to neuro–related audiobooks and podcasts for fun. Overall, this has been a very edifying experience, and I wish Dr. Nusslock nothing but great things. If you have any interest at all in the field, please take this calss!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was the best class of my quarter (and maybe of my entire sophomore year). Take this class!! It's SO interesting, you will learn a ton and Prof. Nusslock is great! I took this as a basic science for McCormick requirements and I highly recommend it – this was more of a ""chill"" class compared to my other engineering classes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"this class is fine. not an easy a, but if you study for the midterm/final, then probably a B+. the other writing assignments were easy. the exams are difficult, even having studied but not impossible and pretty fair. lectures are boring. I am super interested in the content on the brain, but it was more learning about action potentials and specific stuff instead of stuff like anxiety and consciousness, etc. take this if you need to or are interested, but be prepared to study!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Nusslock does a great job of teaching this course from an intro level. He emphasizes all of the important concepts effectively and was always answering questions to the best of his ability.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Interesting topic and the prof is nice, just wish the lectures were recorded. He went slowly whenever we were confused and answered questions in depth so he was very supportive."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Nusslock was amazing! I really enjoyed going to lecture as he always made it really fun but also very informative. I learned so much for an introductory course! The exams and writing assignments were also very straight–forward and graded fairly. Take this class!!
,,,,,,,,,,,I thought this course was good but it was a lot of brute memorization that I did not enjoy.
,,,,,,,,,,,I learned a lot in this class and overall enjoyed it! Exams were difficult and required a lot of studying/basically memorizing the slides. It would have been really nice if lectures were recorded to go back to before exams.
,,,,,,,,,,,Very interesting course – definitely targeted for people who would like to learn about neuroscience that are not neuroscience majors. Prof Nusslock is great as well. Exams contain a lot of memorization but everything that's asked is on the slides – not many curveballs. Great course overall!
,,,,,,,,,,,Dr. Nusslock is the best teacher– he's very clear and always explains things at least 2 times (which is really helpful because I sometimes don't get it the first time around). Really enjoyed this course.
,,,,,,,,,,,loved nusslock! such a compassionate prof and easy class
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great nat sci distro class if science is not your best subject. Nusslock is a great teacher – he lays out the content clearly and repeats concepts multiple times to make sure you understand. Besides the two exams, the only assignments are three reflections which are fairly easy to complete. The exams are also very easy as long as you prepare beforehand."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Would def recommend this class!!! Prof Nusslock is so funny and knowledgeable. He'd always included some fun facts/latest research about the topics we were looking at. He really encourages questions and discussions in class. The discussions we had in this class were so interesting and high–quality, and this is a 100–people class. I'd also suggest going to his office hour. It was very chill and I heard a lot of great stories about his research work and stuff."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course, as I felt it was a fair and in–depth introduction to Neuroscience that gave enough information without feeling overwhelming."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved Professor Nusslock, he is super kind and funny in class. I love his teaching style! The class has two non–cumulative exams, which is nice. I liked what we learned in class."
,,,,,,,,,,,2 exams and 3 writing assignments. This was a good class that builds off topics learned in AP Psych.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved how the prof always engaging the rest of the class during lecture. His lecture style was engaging and he had a funny vibe to him. The three writing assignments were straight forward. The exams were also straightforward, especially if you have some past neuro knowledge"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great, very interesting class. Final exam covers a lot of content, so start studying early. No need to do the readings as long as you attend all lectures and study the content Prof. Nusslock emphasizes in class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really good professor. Hosts review sessions before exams and tells you what to focus on/hints about the exam. Everything on the exam is from the slides and what is taught in class. Really good class. 1000% recommend it. Although the material initially seemed dense, it was manageable and I learnt a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,Really intellectually stimulating professor.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great course especially for McCormick students who want the basic science distribution. It’s applicable in general and the class was just simply interesting. prof Nusslock is awesome too! The tests were very fair and graded leniently, and the written assignments were also not too much work."
,,,,,,,,,,,TAKE THIS CLASS.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Super super dense lectures and content. There was very little outside work, aside from 3 writing assignments on various neuroscience studies, but I often had a hard time following lectures and staying engaged. Exams were multiple choice and short–answers, but a lot of trickiness came up from the hyperspecificness of the questions. For a distro and a psych requirement, it's not too bad of a pick, but I would probably not take this class if it wasn't for being both."
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this course! Prof. Nusslock is a great instructor because he says everything clearly and explains concepts more than once. His slides are also great at being informative and engaging. I found the exams and writing assignments very fair and the content to be very interesting!
,,,,,,,,,,,"really interesting and robin is a really good lecturer. sometimes things got confusing. the class is somewhat approachable if u dont have a background in bio/neuro, and its not very psych heavy. theres some psych relevancy but not too much. still, the content is hard to really nail down. exam was ok if you study the slides, but theres literally so much content so thats way easier said than done. helpful office hours and review sessions. not recorded but slides are posted and the the slides are also really detailed. dont need to read the book that close. its fine as a columm b for psych. 3 pretty easy hw assignments. have to study alot for exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,TAKE THIS CLASS! It is the probably the best class I've taken at Northwestern so far. The professor is truly amazing; he is so passionate about the subject and he genuinely cares about his students. The work is so reasonable and the exams are the fairest ones I've ever taken. The topics can be a bit complex and you definitely need to be good at memorizing but overall it's a really manageable class and the lectures are truly amazing!
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you can memorize and have a little neuroscience background, you will be fine. Otherwise, this course could be challenging. I walked into this class without any background in neuroscience and psychology, and I found the exams to be fair yet slightly challenging. This course is not an easy A."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was pretty decent. As someone who has no experience in STEM, this was a class that was pretty manageable and not too difficult. It's 3 short writing assignments then a midterm/final exam. The great part is that the exam questions do not try to trick you! Nusslock is such a chill prof and a great lecturer. I definitely recommend this as a distro or a Column B for psych"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not too bad of a class, he teaches everything you need top know. Just a lot of memorizing but id take that over a paper all day"
,,,,,,,,,,,this is such an amazing class with one of the best lecturers at NU. Nusslock is so engaging and explains topics so well. He is also very funny. Such a nice man too. 100% take this class no matter what your major is. Many psych lectures like this tend to have less than half attendence on average but not for this class. So many people would attend rightfully. Exams are fair and representative of what we learned. Easy A if you grind maybe a day or two and study terms and learn to apply them. Do not have to read any of the textbooks (i didnt) as only like 3–5 questions on exam are from textbook and sometimes you can still figure them out. So glad i took this class
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a helpful introduction to neuroscience for those without a science background. I appreciated the enthusiasm of the professor and the slow–build nature of the class. Grading is based on 3 short writing assignments, but the majority is two tests."
,,,,,,,,,,,Amazing class. Robin makes you super interested about learning about the brain. I love this class so much.
,,,,,,,,,,,This is such a great course. I was new to psych and I learned so much. Professor Nusslock is amazing!!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Your grades in this course are 85% on two exams, but they aren't that difficult and the average for the first one was a 91%. The rest of it is three short media responses that had an average of 5/5. The course itself was fairly interesting and professor Nusslock teaches the content clearly and with compelling reasoning behind each point he makes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is great! Professor Nusslock is very great at seeing what the students seem confused about and is great at answering questions, so he is very approachable and adjusted the class pace and material to the students. I learned a lot in a not–so–stressful environment. It was a really nice break from my other science courses and did a great job at covering all the main points of neuroscience. I highly recommend taking the class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class! The prof is awesome and gave some of the most engaging lectures I've seen over my 4 years here. He is engaging, passionate, and tells many awesome stories to teach the material. Would recommend as a science distro if you are looking to take this class for that reason."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great teacher, very patient and kind. Learn a lot from this class, but a lot to remember for the exam. Spent time study on them and you will be fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Robin is an incredible lecturer and person, frankly. He's so passionate about neuroscience and helping people; this quality is so evident in his teaching. The class is not an easy A, but it's interesting, fun, and fairly graded. You don't have to go to lectures to get a good grade but honestly I would go because of Prof. Nusslock! The exams are very fair. You need to do a fair amount of studying but you have all the resources you need to do well. If you are at all interested in neuroscience, drugs, psychology, or health, take this class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think this class can be pretty challenging and scary given how the grade is mainly based on two exams but if you keep up with the work and study hard, it's pretty straightforward and easy to succeed in given how it's set up."
wnbg,psych,213,fall,Galen Bodenhausen,5.14,5.13,5.00,4.26,4.96,3.75,Wish there were recordings of the lectures that could be accessed if students are out sick. Bodenhausen is a really good lecturer and the class was enjoyable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was great. Make sure to take time studying for exams and pay attention in class, but it's very manageable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"the professor's lecture style makes it hard to focus sometimes, but all of the information is interesting. you need to pay attention during class because most information is not on lectures slides. exams were all multiple choice and pretty easy if you study everything. i would definitely recommend this course if you're looking for an interesting and moderately easy psych class. you just need to study a lot before the exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great lectures, good slides, somewhat interesting readings"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Highly recommend this class! Attendance is pretty mandatory because there's small writing assignments after class that are worth points, but they were always pretty short and simple. It's a pretty standard lecture class, but the material is usually pretty interesting and there's only three multiple–choice assessments throughout the quarter – 2 midterms and 1 final. Overall as long as you paid attention in class and looked over lecture slides before these, they were pretty straightforward. Once again, highly recommend if you're in need of a Column A or just interested in social psychology!"
,,,,,,,,,,,The content was interesting but lectures were fast paced. I wish there was a study guide for exams
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was really interesting and valuable! However, exams are not easy. Some questions will test your knowledge beyond course materials. I would study weeks before exams and still not do well. I still enjoyed being in the class, I learned a lot!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would absolutely take this class again. It was interesting, sometimes funny, but also easy. Daily writing prompts are graded basically just as attendance points, and then three non–cumulative exams that (if you go to lecture) are very straightforward. The readings, while helpful for me because the repetition helps me study, are not needed."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is very fun! Professor Bodenhausen conveys all concepts in very understandable chunks, and the class was rarely a source of stress. There is one double–edged sword with this class, which is the fact that all exams account for around 92% of the course grade. While this leads to very little tension outside of exam weeks for this class, it also means that each exam has the capability of dragging your grade down. However, overall, the class was very enjoyable and the topics covered are very useful. 8.3/10"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course works very well as a distro requirement; the content is interesting and the professor welcomes questions/is very knowledgeable about what he teaches. It requires minimal work outside of class, and the writing assignments after each lecture were very easy but useful summaries of the lecture content and its applicability to our lives."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great class, Professor Bodenhausen is the best! I can't say enough good things. Prof Bodenhausen is a great lecturer, the classes are super engaging and interesting, there's a lot of information to take in but he does a great job connecting it all together and providing lots of interesting research and examples. Whether you're a psych major or just looking for a distro, this class is a very comprehensive intro to social psych that will provide you with a ton of relevant knowledge to your everyday life and answer a lot of questions you've probably long wondered about human behavior. There's hardly any outside work for the class outside of prepping for exams, which are all multiple choice and very fair. Again, would highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great class! Although a lot of people said it would be an easy A, I would not say that it is. It is very content heavy, and the exams were very nitpicky and sometimes had ambiguous questions. You really can't just get an easy A; maybe easy B+! Professor Bodenhausen is very knowledgable, and wants to see you succeed, so utilize him as a resource! Sometimes, lectures may be boring and long, but the information is very interesting and applicable to us as humans! Take this class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is genuinely an interesting class. I would say test scores heavily influence grading. This class is not too much work, with two midterms, a final, and small writing assignments at the end of each class. The exams were really long, especially the final! Tests are all multiple choice and are HEAVILY based on lecture content, so make sure that you know everything that was shared in class because it would most likely be in the exams!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great class. Social psychology is so interesting and this class touches on a bunch of different aspects of the topic. There are 2 midterms and 1 final; all are multiple choice and you only need to review lecture notes and the chapter summaries from the textbook. Very low stress class, so I was able to actually enjoy the material and learn from it. Bodenhousen has a monotone voice but his passion for the subject still shines through."
,,,,,,,,,,,NA
,,,,,,,,,,,"The professor is somewhat monotonous, but I'm very interested in the concepts we learned about, so I loved the lectures. He clearly knew what he was talking about. The exams were very fair. Very well–organized class overall."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class really taught me a lot and was very easy to understand because the syllabus was extremely clear. The readings could be long (around 40 pgs twice a week), but they are not difficult to read, and each exam was reasonable if you take good notes on the lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,If you are looking to take a interesting course where you aren't constantly stressed about your grade I strongly suggest this class! The content was very interesting and applicable to real life and the testing format was extremely fair and easy to succeed on for those who payed attention to the in class lectures.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, this was a good course. Professor Bodenhausen is very understanding and knowledgeable about social psych. Your grade is composed of 2 midterms, 1 final, and several 1–2 pt writing exercises at the end of each lecture (attendance is essentially mandatory). As long as you study, the exams are pretty fair, and it's not too difficult to finish with an A in this class. Lectures can feel a bit long at times, but the course material is very relevant/interesting – would recommend!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was easy and did not require much work. Lectures were definitely interesting but sometimes lacked engagement. I would recommend this course if you are truly interested in psychology.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was super reasonable in terms of workload/readings and test material. It was a lot of just lecturing, but it was easy to follow, and having such a manageable class during an otherwise overwhelming quarter literally saved me."
,,,,,,,,,,,Very fun and easy course. Engaging lectures teaching you interesting information about psychology.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course covered a lot of information and moved very fast, but Prof. Bodenhausen made all of it very interesting and digestible. The exams this quarter were all multiple choice, which made them slightly less stressful, but they would ask questions about very minute details from the class, meaning that you really have to stay focused during lecture. While attendance is not required, there are daily writing prompts that account for part of your grade and if you miss a lecture, it will be very hard to get the meaningful information from the class you missed for the exam. Bodenhausen is very helpful and you can tell he really cares about the topics that are covered. In all, I would highly recommend taking this class if you have any interest in psychology or social processes."
,,,,,,,,,,,Absolutely love this class and professor Bodenhausen!! You can get an A if you pay attention and work hard! The writing exercises at the end of classes are actually very helpful!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty easy course, 3 exams but the last one is cumulative. A chapter of reading before class but nothing to difficult and in–class writing assignments that are basically free points for showing up to class. Subject matter is mostly interesting though at times is repetitive of what you might have learned in other introductory psych classes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very low commitment class. Class responses after each lecture, so attendance is mandatory and 3 exams. Keep in mind that because there are limited assignments, the exams are highly weighted. Even though I did well on all three (80+) and never missed an assignment, I ended with a B. Exams are easy if you pay attention to lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,"the course material was interesting, but the lectures could get boring at times"
,,,,,,,,,,,"It is pretty much a 100% lecture and exam course, with no homework or quizzes, just exams and in–class brief writing exercises after each lecture. The lectures are interesting and important but I did struggle with having nothing to practice and reinforce the information learned in lectures given through the course itself."
,,,,,,,,,,,I found it interesting to compare with what I saw in the world
,,,,,,,,,,,Love this course. Professor is a great lecturer and the content is inherently interesting. Each class ends with a writing exercise worth one point to encourage attendance and the three exams are super straightforward if you review the material. Can't recommend this course enough; easy and engaging.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This prof helps you learn by the examples he gives. I basically just went to lectures and paid attention and took notes and had to do no outside work until it was time to study for an exam. 2 exams and a final, no papers or anything. Chill but interesting, I would definitely recommend – especially because I took this class with orgo and bio."
,,,,,,,,,,,The course was pretty good. 3 tests and some in class writing excursuses was it. The content was genuinely interesting and fun to learn about but it all was just given in lecture form that didn’t excite me
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a really great class! The topics covered were all really interesting. My biggest recommendation is going to lectures. Over 80% of the exam questions are based on what's mentioned in the lectures, and there are writing exercises at the end of each class where you can earn extra points to improve your overall grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,"3 exams... goes off points not percentages, get points for going to class!! not too hard just make you study at least a few hours before the test"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty solid, course material was interesting but not revolutionary. Tests were chill, professor was chill, nothing was notably good or bad."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was relatively straightforward since the material was generally applicable to real–world social situations, making it more interesting to study. The exams were relatively fair – the second midterm weighted slightly more than the first, building up to the final which counted for the most points. In–class exercises were helpful because they forced me to actively think about the lecture material rather than just simply copying notes and reviewing concepts only before midterms/the final."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is very straightforward – go to lecture, take notes, take a writing check at the end, and take 3 multiple choice tests throughout the quarter. Overall interesting, though make sure to study carefully"
,,,,,,,,,,,never did readings but you do have to pay good attention in class. Class can feel long and tedious but the interesting stuff is really interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Social psychology is really interesting. You definitely need to go to lecture to do well in this course– attendance is graded and the lecture slides are not enough to learn the content. This can be kind of unfortunate because the lectures are a little dull if I'm being honest. Nevertheless, the class is well organized and it's easy to follow along and grasp new content. Would recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was great, I would highly recommend it for a Psychology major/minor requirement or just to take in general. Lectures are so engaging every day, Professor Bodenhausen explains things thoroughly, and assignments are super fair. There is no homework besides chapter readings, but you can honestly get away without doing those for exams as long as you skim them and read the chapter summaries. Attendance is somewhat mandatory because there is a super short, 1–point writing assignment at the end of each class based on lectures (graded fairly and only a few sentences). There are 2 midterms and 1 final, which are also very fair. I loved this class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,It really focused on the social aspect of psychology which I was already really interested in.
,,,,,,,,,,,Good class. Grading was 2 midterms and a final as well as daily in class writing exercises worth 1 point. If you go to class and study before the exams then you will do well. Also pretty interesting in my opinion. Bodenhausen is a great professor. Very chill class environment. Would recommend for psych majors/minors and for distro.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Lectures are interesting, and as long as you're paying attention to what he talks about in class, the tests shouldn't be too bad. Very little work outside of class, but the tests were a little trickier than I was expecting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The tests were fair, lectures were interesting, the only part of the class I would chnage are the readings. I did not do them, and you really did not have to. They honestly caused more confusion than help."
,,,,,,,,,,,Im really glad that I took this course! The material is very interesting and helps you see interactions and relationships from a new perspective.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class was interesting, the reading was not difficult or time consuming. The exams were very fair and straightforward."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class! Professor Bodenhausen is great and he really knows the subject. Lectures were interesting and he did a thorough job explaining the material. It was an easy class to suceed in. There were small writing assignments (just write a few sentences) at the end of each class, worth about one point each. Attendance was pretty important for that reason. Textbook readings (provided for free online) were assigned as homework after each class, but they didn't take that long. They weren't super necessary to complete, but I did think it was helpful to read them for tests. There were two midterms (multiple choice) and then the final (also multiple choice). Overall, Prof Bodenhausen did a great job explaining all the concepts and stimulating interest in the subject."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The teacher is great, the slides are clear, and the exams are what the teacher says they will be. There is no homework"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Galen is a great teacher –– subject matter was interesting and galen managed to present it in a way that felt engaging while not pandering. Good examples of concepts, decently easy exams, overall great class. This is the only class I had this quarter where I voluntarily went to lecture every day because I actually enjoyed it"
,,,,,,,,,,,An easy A– if you show up to class.
wnbg,psych,213,winter,Daniel Molden,4.59,4.41,4.81,4.32,4.39,7.95,"This class was interesting and not very difficult, but it was very time consuming. Molden is a great professor though."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was the most poorly structured class I have taken so far. For starters, we pay for platforms to do discussions and attendance (my other classes have had free methods to do stuff like this such as poll everywhere and canvas). You also do modules (a.k.a the lecture) twice a week which are ridiculously time consuming. Lectures are required but pointless because they reiterate everything you just watched the night before with a sprinkle of new information. Then there are two essays per week (max 2 pages), which doesn't sound bad in hindsight but they are so particular with grading that you have spend extra time scouring your notes to formulate the perfect answer because if you don't give them exactly what they want points are deducted. In all honestly the content isn't even that hard and it's actually interesting but the poor structuring of this class and excessive amount of work made me dislike the class. I know he gives reasoning for all of these methods which I gave them the benefit of the doubt, but after going through it some serious changes need to be considered because he's teaching a class fully in person as if were in COVID."
,,,,,,,,,,,"No complaints, it was a fun and interesting class, good for distros."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a very stimulating course. You'll learn a lot of very relevant and interesting information that shows up in all aspects of life. It is, however, a good amount of work. It is all manageable once you get the hang of it but be intentional in the first few weeks to set up a system so you submit all of your assignments on time. No tests, just short answer papers and a take home final. Very nice."
,,,,,,,,,,,"THIS CLASS WAS SO MUCH WORK. I was so excited to take social psych because I find the material super interesting, however I'm so upset that I didn't read the CTECS before enrolling with Prof Molden. Every week you have to write 6 short discussion questions and 2 short responses. On top of that you have to watch lecture videos and do readings. Basically you have an assignment due monday, tues, and wed, which was annoying and super time consuming. The perk about this class is no in person midterm/final. While this sounds great in theory, the short answers were graded really harshly and what I thought would be an easy A turned into a difficult A–. If you really hate taking exams maybe this class is for you, but I would rather study for a day or two for an exam twice a quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class however it is very very time–consuming. There are no midterms or finals and a lot of opportunities for extra credit, but the class has a lot of required readings and additional lecture videos. Professor Molden is a very engaging lecturer and the material is very interesting. I also felt that the assignments were graded pretty harshly and require a lot of effort and understanding. Overall, I would recommend this course. I learned a lot and enjoyed the material presented."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I didn't realize to what extent this course would make me reflect on Social Psych applications in the real world, but, again Professor Molden did a great job at providing this aspect"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is so dry and bland that it's pretty easy to disengage from the material. I was actually really interested in the subject and excited to take the class, but I felt like all the curiosity and fun was sucked out of it because of the lectures and the redundancy of the coursework. First off, if you take this class, expect to pay about $60 for subscriptions to an attendance software and a Canvas discussion board with a word minimum. That being said, part of what made this course so unfulfilling for me was that I felt like I was just doing work all the time. We always had two discussion posts due a week (which were like a paragraph because the software won't let you submit unless you reach the minimum) and then you had to respond to TWO people's posts (which were also like a paragraph). In addition, we also had two questions to answer every week, which would require content from both the lectures and the supplemental materials and would be graded super harshly (depending on your grader). The questions always took me so long because I found myself endlessly searching the lectures and other materials in order to craft the best answers. The lectures themselves were always un–engaging and boring, and sometimes hard to keep up note–taking because most of the info we needed to know wasn't even on the slides. All the information of the course was really interesting, but the way it was presented made me dread the subject. If you have a genuine interest in this subject, maybe take this class with a different professor, I think you might get more out of it if it was structured differently."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was disappointed in this class and would not really recommend it. While it was nice not to have to worry about exams, there was so much work outside of class and a lack of communication about grading. I was very frustrated with the modules we had to complete before every lecture as the same information would be repeated in the in person lecture. They felt like a waste of time more times than not. The weekly assignments in theory are great, as they test understanding while not requiring that the course have exams, but there was no feedback given on the assignments so it was hard to know how to improve your grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was pretty straightforward in regards to both expectations and content. There are no midterms which are nice, but be prepared to constantly do work as there is something – either a short answer or a discussion post– due almost each day. But overall, a very interesting class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"In exchange for no midterms and a test final, you have to sacrifice a lot of time doing tedious discussion posts and somewhat lengthy assignments every week. I did learn a lot in this manner but it made me REALLY burnt out by the end because it was a lot. The materials needed for the course could be annoying because you need to pay money for certain programs online."
,,,,,,,,,,,Decently interesting course with a solid amount of work required outside of class.
,,,,,,,,,,,The 2 assignments weekly and backpack felt a bit tedious and a bit unenjoyanle tbh but it’s not too bad. Super interesting content though. Like learning abt how ppl work in society and such – pretty dope
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class with Molden was awesome. He was engaging, funny, and I feel like I really learned a lot. There were also no exams, which was a huge bonus. The modules did get somewhat extensive in terms of time spent on them, and at times also felt repetitive with the information covered in lecture. Basically you have to watch lecture videos and read articles for every class before the class happens, and post on a discussion board before class as well. Aside from this, you just had to answer one short answer questions per class, which wasn't bad and were always graded pretty fairly. I would definitely recommend this class for anybody, because the material is not hard to grasp and is applicable for every major."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The subject is pretty interesting, but the class requires a substantial amount of work every week so do not take this as a fifth class. If you put in the work, you'll be fine– I would say this class is an easy B+/A– but not that easy to get an A. You have to do 2 short answer questions (up to 2 pages double spaced) every week that are graded pretty hard, so you have to really stay on top of things. However, the professor does offer extra credit opportunities to help make up the lost points."
,,,,,,,,,,,Interesting class.
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is really interesting and you will learn a lot. The workload is not light and there are discussion posts twice a week as well as 14 2–page papers throughout the quarter. There are no exams but there is a final 'paper' which is 5 of the same style 2–page papers. Molden is a great professor the subject material is genuinely interesting. Attendance is taken and there are a lot of opportunities for extra credit.
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is pretty manageable if you can manage your time well. It can be overwhelming if you cram the assignments till the last minute to do them.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Molden is a fun, relatable, and knowledgeable professor. Class consists of two 2 page essays a week, two modules that have a few readings and lectures, as well as two discussion posts/responses a week. This class is no breeze. It isn't particularly hard so much as time consuming. DEFINITELY possible to get an A so long as you are consistent in your work. Recommend the course, but not if you have other classes taking large portions of your time"
,,,,,,,,,,,"(With Prof. Molden) This class was a LOT of outside of class work, most notbly over the weekend. Especially towards the beginning of the class, it was difficult to remember what was due when, with discussion posts/replies due Monday and Wednesday at noon and ""short"" answer questions (up to 2 pages double spaced) due at 11 for Tuesday class. I particularly disliked the ""Lecture Videos"" we were required to watch before each class to formulate discussion posts, which were essentially an abridged version of the lecture we had to attend the next day. Although attempts were made to be engaging, I felt lectures were typically very basic/unstimulating, like you would see in a movie. As for short answer questions, huge lack of transparency in how grades were assigned. Although comments were left by TAs, I never knew exactly where I lost points, or how many I would lose for a small error. They consistently wanted their EXACT ""correct"" answer, not just a well–formulated one (eg. you would miss points if you mentioned the wrong study, even if it supported the response correctly)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a lot of work, but not stressful. Sometimes the writing assignments were frustrating because I'd get points taken off for things I didn't know I was supposed to include. The content was overall pretty interesting and applicable to life."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I absolutely loved this course!! I have never taken a social psychology class in the past, so I was very interested coming in, and that passion grew even further as I found the content very engaging. Assignments were also pretty easy to complete if you just refer back to lecture videos and notes, and we also had to post discussion posts/responses twice a week which weren't bad because you did not have to write too much. Everything that was graded–– even the final exam–– was done out of class which was SO NICE because you never had to stress about cramming content or studying. And although I found myself spending a good amount of time on notes, I actually enjoyed the flipped classroom structure as it made the in–person lectures much easier to follow. In all, I am really glad that I decided to take this course; I got a lot out of it, and it was very stress free :)"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class felt really manageable! I appreciated not having any classic timed exams in this class, though as a result you do have to be on top of your assignments. I ultimately liked the use of TopHat and Packback, and really appreciated the availability of Panopto lecture videos and lecture recordings so I could go back to rewatch things. Additionally, Professor Molden is funny and made the lectures engaging and enjoyable. If you're planning on taking Social Psych, take it with Professor Molden!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"There's two short answer questions with a max of two pages, double spaced, and a discussion post due a day before each class. You only got four days to do the short answer questions (including the weekend) which was annoying, especially since the the assignments wouldn't be released at a set time on Thursday. The grading is really up to the TAs discretion, which felt very subjective at times, but going to office hours helps a lot. The homework is often looking for a specific answer, which took me a while to learn. Overall, this class is a lot more work than I expected, but not too bad."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This content of the class was extremely interesting. I found it even more interesting because I could apply / see what we learned in class in my daily life. However, lectures sometimes got a bit boring and it was hard to stay engaged sometimes. This course is also all writing: there's no finals or midterms, just 2 two–page papers due every week. There are also discussion questions due the day before class lectures. Although no exams are nice, the writing can get very overwhelming at times. Also, there are lecture videos to watch before lectures, which also takes up a good amount of time. Ultimately, the class isn't hard if you are able to keep up with all of the writing and assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was alright, but way more work than I think it needs to be. There was 1 discussion post and 2 responses required per class (2 posts, 4 responses per week), a 1–2 page paper about the topic per class (2 papers per week), and a lot of readings and lecture videos and supplemental videos to complete before each class. I really enjoyed learning about social psychology and I think the information/knowledge is a lot more important that people realize, but it's a lot of work. Lectures, though, don't provide much new information. Also attendance is ""mandatory"" in the sense that Professor Molden takes attendance and it counts towards your grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Molden does not give exams, so if you don't prefer tests, this could be for you. He does give a decent workload each week, however, which is composed of two two–page papers, and posting on a discussion board. His lectures are a bit more engaging than usual; he uses Top Hat for attendance and to ask us the occasional question each lecture. He also offers a good amount of extra credit, which he holds optional lectures for. Be aware that you need to pay for two course materials, Top Hat and Packback, which, if I remember correctly, cost $30 each."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really did like the content of the course and how applicable it was to my life. I would say the hardest part is just how much time you have to invest into the homework because a lot of the learning is done outside of the classroom. Every class has a new module due which means watching lecture videos and reading articles each night which can take a couple hours at times. You really need to be able to absorb a lot of new information very quickly to succeed in this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,Everything you learn is relevant to your life and you'll realise that you're not weird and operate like everyone else.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very interesting course. Does have a time requirement due to weekly assignments and discussion posts. However, these assignments definitely help you to learn and apply the material"
,,,,,,,,,,,"There are two short papers due each week, along with questions and responses to pre–class readings. The papers can be written quickly as long as you pay attention while doing the readings and in class. The questions about and responses to other people's questions for the pre–class readings are a little tedious but aren't that bad. Overall, you learn a lot, the instructor is very engaging, extra credit is simple, and the class is good."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The material was interesting, but Molden is a jerk. He can be disorganized and does not have sympathy to students. He also uses outdated words like ""transexual"" and is not very friendly or open to the LGBTQ community."
,,,,,,,,,,,There is a lot of writing in this class but if you pay attention in the lecture it is not too difficult. The final is long and more challenging but it is overall a very manageable class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was really interesting. However, there is a lot of work required outside of class, including two modules (with a few hours of reading and videos in each), two discussion questions and four replies, and two short answer questions. I definitely learned a lot, but the fact that the short answer questions were looking for the exact right answer when the information we were given was ambiguous made it hard to stay motivated. I put in a lot of time in this class, and while it was super interesting content, it was by no means an easy A and was frustrating at times."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I appreciated the time that Prof Molden put into his lecture slides and how he taught classes. if you don't like taking exams, this is the class for you!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Decent course, especially if you are a generally stressed individual. There were no exams, and if you're an experienced writer the 2, 2–page essays per week are not difficult to do well on. The lectures are somewhat dry, though, as they are essentially repeats of the weekly modules, so feel extremely repetitive."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Okay this class's contents are really interesting and useful for real–life, but be aware that there is a lot of work involved. Instead of taking any tests or midterms, you have to do A LOT of reading and writing which is useful for learning but can be very burdensome if you don't organize your time well. Some of the work can seem repetitive after a while as he repeats the same information in the lectures, but overall it's still a good class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course was interesting and allowed students to explore topics that interested them through suggested reading and posting questions on packback. Lecture videos were posted before class so that class time could be focused on answering student questions and exploring the topics more closely. However, we needed to write two fairly short essays a week, which in and of itself was not an issue. However, the grading for these essays seemed to be pretty inconsistent as it didn't follow a rubric and so at times grades didn't seem to be fair, especially when comparing with essays that my classmates wrote."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Molden is a phenomenal lecturer and very understanding. I felt that the amount of writing that needed to be done was a bit overhyped by CTECs and even the notice we got at the beginning of class––if you're capable of spacing out the work and not leaving it until the last minute it's nothing unmanageable, just two discussion posts and two 1–2 page short responses, which was mostly just restating what we went over in lecture. While I usually find textbooks hard to digest, the readings were relatively easy to get through. As for Molden, his lectures are entertaining and engaging, and the extra credit sessions are definitely worth going to even if you don't write the extra short response."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is really interesting and teaches you a lot of info you'll use in daily life. There's no timed finals, but a lot of content to go through before lectures and lots of due dates throughout the week. You can skim through a lot of the articles that are posted."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I like the structure of the class. We are given short (like 5 minute) lecture videos before the actual lecture. Has all the info. The full lectures are also uploaded online, although participation and attendance are graded. Lots of work, not difficult just tedious. Grading is a bit annoying, not an easy A class but could be if you put in the effort."
,,,,,,,,,,,Molden was good because there are no tests. But he is unorganized and doesn't rlly explain anything. He is okay as a teacher but the subject is mid its all common sense.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The topic of this course is interesting and the lectures will keep you engaged. Professor Molden is a great lecturer and makes his lectures engaging by encouraging discussion and activities. Although the weekly assignments and Packback are time consuming, they really help in your understanding and it's a great trade off since you don't get traditional midterms and final exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,I thought that pack back was a completely unnecessary expense and we could have just used canvas to do discussion posts instead. I thought that it was a good class because the content was always interesting but the way it was taught definitely got boring at times.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course. I felt that I learned a lot, and the readings and assignments were very manageable. Each week, there are 2 discussion posts that don't take very long, and one or two writing assignments that are between 1–2 pages. The writing assignments were not very hard because the citations were not as formal as a normal writing class. The instruction was great, and I just had a great time in this course."
wnbg,psych,213,spring,Wendi Gardner,5.69,5.47,5.55,4.85,5.62,4.09,Yes. Wendi explains everything well and lecture slides are very informative.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is such a fun and interesting class– I’m so happy I took it with Prof. Gardner. It’s pretty similar to most psych classes offered here in terms of format. Classes are engaging and interesting, but exams are challenging, so make sure you begin studying several days in advance!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gardener is great and very passionate, which makes lectures a lot more engaging. Take advantage of all of the extra credit assignments! Not super hard to get an A in this class if you study the material"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Gardner seemed really interested in the content and I was genuinely really excited to go to class every time. The information on the tests was pretty nitpicky, but otherwise, I really recommend this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Wendi is one of the best professors on this campus and really wants you to succeed! Very interesting content, some of the most engaging lectures, relatively easy, totally would recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course! So interesting and Professor Gardner is an amazing professor. There are short weekly quizzes, 2 team papers, and 2 non–cumulative midterms. The midterms were reasonable and the papers are fun."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I wish lectures were recorded. Only cons are that there are textbook readings tested on that aren't recorded in lecture. However, the course load is super manageable. You will also have two group projects. I enjoy working with others so it was okay."
,,,,,,,,,,,"You should take this course! It was very intuitive and we learned about very applicable areas of psychology, including stereotypes, advertising, attraction, and more. Exams are fair, mostly based on lecture and a couple textbook chapters that she outlines on the syllabus! Prof Gardner is a great lecturer and very friendly and approachable."
,,,,,,,,,,,very very interesting course. wendi is amazing but likes to trick you with some questions. lots lots of information and pretty much have to know it all for the tests. whole grade is basically made of two tests so be mindful of that. overall very interesting info.
,,,,,,,,,,,Wendi is such an amazing lecturer and makes it very easy to understand the concepts. The exams are fair and very reflective of the material presented in class.
,,,,,,,,,,,such a good class! everyone should take it with Professor Gardner she is the best lecturer and makes the class so interesting!
,,,,,,,,,,,"this has been my favorite class I've ever taken at northwestern. the lectures were so engaging and fun, ppt slides were very well organized, assignments and syllabus were very organized and easy to navigate/follow, and Gardner is so sweet and quick in responding to emails. lots of extra credit opportunities too. just go to class and read the slides and you'll get an A and you'll also learn a lot of interesting psych facts that u can apply to your social life and social skills"
,,,,,,,,,,,I like the topic but found the class to be a little bit difficult than it should have been. Lectures aren't recorded and you miss a lot from not attending so you've really got to be on your A–game every lecture. Gardner is nice though and clearly passionate about the subject.
,,,,,,,,,,,Really good and pretty easy!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty interesting, not a lot of work outside of paying attention in lectures; Wendi is a very passionate professor who clearly loves what she does which makes the content very wholesome and inspiring."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class with Professor Gardner! I cannot recommend her enough. Her lectures are genuinely interesting and she goes over lots of studies with each topic. Each class is pretty interesting and you learn valuable information that can be applied to your own lives. She makes it so that you do not have to do much reading outside of class and will only assign necessary readings which aren't bad at all. Overall, your grade will consist of weekly open–note quizzes, 2 group papers, and 2 exams (no final during finals week!). It is important to do well on the exams but you can definitely do really well if you put in the work! Also, Prof. Gardner is very understanding and kind and it is worth your time to reach out if you have any questions."
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof Gardner is THE BEST. She is seriously then most amazing lecturer and this is hands down the best class I've taken at Northwestern. All the topics were so interesting and applicable to everyday life. Gardner makes gilmore girls references while really getting the crucial information across: take this class with her!
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Gardner is amazing! I would definitely recommend this class for other people to take. You learn a lot about different concepts to apply in different social contexts and it's not much work outside of class. The only downside is that your grade is based on 2 exams.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVE WENDI!! You need to take this class with Wendi Gardner she is my queen. This class is amazing! The workload is fine and the lectures are incredibly engaging and Wendi is just an amazing professor. Somehow this class taught me not just about social psychology, but about how to be a better person and friend to those around me. I loved this course and I love Wendi!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Wendi's a sweetheart, but she has a tendency to mumble and go off on a tangent from time to time, so lectures can be made really confusing if you're not paying attention. Same goes for slides; they're very disorganized and full of grammar mistakes, so attending class is a must. Workload–wise, this class is pretty chill. Two midterms, two team papers, no final, and lots of EC opportunities (although grading takes absolutely forever). Team papers were the most stressful part of this class; make sure to get a good team that actually pulls their own weight, because everyone gets the same grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed this course and Wendi is an amazing professor! The only problem was some of the lectures felt a little from time to time but I think that depended mostly on my personal interest in the topics covered in those specific lectures. 2 exams (half multiple choice + 2 short answer + 1 longer answer questions) + 2 group projects (half or one page per person) + weekly open note quizzes (lowest one gets dropped). Overall very doable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is challenging. Overall, there are weekly quizzes, 2 team papers with a group, and 2 exams (no final). Therefore, the class finishes before reading week which I really liked. She gives extra credit but the tests are difficult and not always straightforward. However, Professor Gardner is awesome and very encouraging."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Deceivingly easy to get a B instead of an A. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and Gardener was an amazing professor and the class is set up very nicely. Two midterms that were fair, but the multiple choice was trickier than expected. Everyone should take this class you learn a lot about yourself and your friends/family."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Incredible course! Truly taught me so much. Wendi is truly the best! Such an amazing professor. The lecture material was always so engaging. Course grade is based on 2 non–cumulative exams, which involve multiple choice and short answer questions, weekly quizzes, and 2 team papers. There are also many extra credit opportunities sprinkled throughout the course. 10/10"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a fantastic class to take, especially with Gardner. She's extremely engaging, even with a lecture format. The information is interesting, well presented, and applicable to everyday life. The workload is quite light, with weekly short quizzes, two group papers, and many extra credit opportunities. This is a great class to take if you are at all interested in the subject or are looking even just looking for a distro."
,,,,,,,,,,,"10/10 course, one of the best I've taken at Northwestern! After taking psych 110, I knew I had some interest in psychology. This course helped me expand my knowledge on one aspect of the field and was very fun. I think the topics are super interesting and Professor Gardner does an amazing job explaining them. The tests are hard because they cover a lot of material but not too bad if you study in advance."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned the most in this class than any other class offered at Northwestern and I'm not even a psych major. I took this class as a prereq for IMC and it was the best decision I made. Although it was a little difficult studying for the exams since I didn't how they would be structured (this was my first psych class ever), I am not even mad at the grade I got on the exam because I learned so much useful and applicable lessons through this class. This is a very very highly recommended course I would encourage anyone at NU to take it, especially with Wendi."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gardener is amazing!!! She is so passionate and a great lecturer. Also funny!! 2 non–cumulative exams, 2 group projects (which I was not a fan of, bc who likes counting on other people), easy weekly open–note quizzes, and a few opportunities for extra credit. I was denied my extended due date accommodation, but it won't make an impact on my final grade so I just let it go. Make sure you get things in on time because you'll lose half of the points available. But Wendi is amazing. Take this class with her!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was very straightforward and easy to do well if you complete the assignments. The tests are a little tricky but there are a lot of extra credit opportunities.
,,,,,,,,,,,"one of my favorite class at northwestern. always go to lecture, wendi is a fantastic lecturer. exams are not hard at all, just make flashcards and study lecture material"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Omg this course is awesome, I can't recommend it enough, Professor Gardner is so freaking cool"
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Prof Gardner is so invested in the topic and makes the class interesting. You will learn a lot, plus it is an easy A"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this class, but I wish the quarter system allowed us to go more in–depth with the topics––nonetheless, it was still a very enjoyable course. You get to learn a lot of topics within social psychology, such as relationships and stereotyping/prejudice. Prof. Gardner was very engaging and easy to listen to. I liked the content but didn't really like how the class was graded. The tests were harder than I feel they should have been; they weren't horrible, but they were definitely harder than many of the other 200–level psych courses I've taken. There were also two group papers, which I did not enjoy all that much. Definitely take this class with friends if you could, because you have to pick your own groups. The first paper was kind of fun––you plan a commercial together, and then each group member explained a specific aspect of the commercial. The second paper did not make sense to me as a group paper though. I would have much rather preferred it to be individual because it was very hard to piece together everyone's individual knowledge, and the paper ended up not being very cohesive."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The Professor is an AMAZING lecturer. I was very engaged in each session and was almost disappointed when the class was up. The exams were pretty fair, a little lower of an average than I’m used to in psych classes, though. Still, super worthwhile to take this class! There are two group projects, which were very much not my favorite, but I would still take this class again given the chance."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Absolutely awesome course. 11/10 recommend. Prof Gardner is spectacular and engaging. The first half is good but the second half of the class was fantastic. You get to learn about the psychology of love, friendship, biases, and decision making"
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was a pretty hard class, and I didn't do to well. Theres two exams, but the second exam is on content from week 4ish to the end. Exams consist of 40–50 multiple choice, 2–3 short answers, and an essay component. If you need accomodations, GET IT. I was not able to finish the exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,OHHH MY GODDD I LOVE WENDI GARDNER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazing lecturer and super engaging. Definitely take this class!! My one issue was those quizzes due at 1!:59 on Sundays. They're super straightforward and are easy As but I kept forgetting that deadline and hurt my grade ;–;
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gardner is an amazing professor! This was a great class, and I learned so much. The lectures were easy to follow, and the information was interesting. If you want to know more about social psychology then I would recommend taking this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I love this prof and the structure of this class!! Though I've taken many psych classes, I wasn't initially that interested in social psych, and I only took it for the Column A req. I actually was going to take it a previous quarter with another professor, but I dropped within a week because the structure of that class was so different and had significantly more busy work. But after taking this class with Prof. Gardner, I've come to really appreciate some of the things I learned, and I'm actually going to remember many of these concepts because they're so applicable to my own life (relationships, stereotypes, goal–setting, etc.) Super chill class, just two exams and two team projects. Definitely recommend!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved the professor, she was so nice and made lectures really interesting. There are 2 exams with multiple choice and 3 essays, and weekly quizzes. There are also a lot of extra credit opportunities. The textbook isn't necessary to do well, but there are usually 2–4 multiple choice questions on the exam. Take this class with Gardner!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I love Professor Gardner, she clearly knows exactly what she is talking about and knows how to explain the concepts with great examples. Also very willing to help in OH. Like any psych class it was a lot of content and memorization, but I would definitely take it with Prof Gardner!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you are considering taking any psychology course–– whether it be for a distro, major/minor requirement, or just for fun–– definitely take social psych with Wendi! She is such a caring and understanding professor. She is an amazing lecturer, and the way she explains the content is in such an easy way to understand. The content of the course is very relatable to everyday life, and the research Wendi uses really helps in comprehending the topic. The class isn't the most difficult either, and an A is definitely possible. I highly recommend taking this class, especially with Wendi!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gardner is extremely nice, but I lost interest in the subject as we continued through the quarter. Maybe it was because I took her course at 5 pm, but Gardner's lectures seemed very mundane. As well, the exam format: 35–40 multiple choice, two short answers, and an essay seemed excessive for the time allowed to complete the exam."
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS W/ WENDI U WILL LEARN HOW TO NOT BE LONELY AND STAY IN LOVE AND HELP OTHER PEOPLE!!! LOVED EVERY MOMENT (i was actually sad for this class to be over which almost never happens) WENDI IS THE ABSOLUTE SWEETEST <3333 and also so funny i was losing it when she said all little kids are shaped like vienna sausages. this was fr one of my favorite classes i've taken at NU and i would highly recommend for anyone even if u aren't a psych major bc u learn so many rly relevant things about life & people & yourself!! overall it's v chill, lectures are super interesting and the only assignments are 2 exams and 2 group papers –– the papers are also pretty fun u get to design a commercial for one, and design prejudice interventions in schools for the other, which are both super relevant to learn how to persuade people and not be a prejudiced person! you don't really need to read the textbook, except for the sections highlighted on the syllabus **WHICH WILL BE ON THE EXAM** but it's pretty interesting!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is a great option if you want to get a lay of the land when it comes to social psychology! Professor Gardner covered a variety of topics, including prejudice/biases, romantic relationships, the universality of beauty, just to name a few. I would recommend you do skim/read the textbook sections required, as there are specific questions on the exams about this. The class was overall fun and interesting!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gardner is such an amazing lecturer. This was by far my favorite class I've taken at Northwestern so far, and I'm almost done with my psych major. All the topics we learned about were so relevant to life and she made everything so easy to understand that it just stuck in my mind and I didn't really need to study much for exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,overall i really liked the material in this class. you have 2 projects and two midterms and that's it. that means each thing is kind of worth a lot so that makes it hard if you mess something up to recover. make sure to do all the extra credit
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is great! Two fairly easy group projects and two non cumulative exams that weren’t bad as long as you pay attention in class and study a bit. Professor is amazing!!
,,,,,,,,,,,"I love Gardner and her lectures were amazing! I did feel like the exams were quite difficult, with the multiple choice just feeling like a series of gotcha questions, and with the exams being worth so much of the grade, it was a frustrating aspect of the class. But Gardner is a great lecturer; she's very knowledgeable in the field and very caring and attentive at answering questions and explaining concepts."
wnbg,psych,215,fall,Alissa Chung,5.75,5.34,5.21,4.71,5.52,4.78,Professor Chung is really nice and a great lecturer! As a non major and also someone who took this P/NP there were a lot of interesting reads but also a lot of memorization involved. The subject material overall was pretty engaging
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Chung manages to make a lecture–sized class feel personalized and engaging. She explains complex subjects with clarity and always makes herself available for additional help. Unlike other large psychology classes, grades are not limited to just two exams per quarter; she includes opportunities for participation, project, and quiz grades to ensure a fair reflection of students' effort. The class material itself is interesting and relevant to real–life issues."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed the material in the course. Sometimes, it could be a bit repetitive but overall it was a great learning experience. I enjoyed how we used some of class time to go through case studies and discuss. The papers were also interesting and fun to write."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Although Professor Chung is very kind and understanding, I found her class hard to follow and her first exam very challenging. She does give you all the time you need to finish your exam, but it was way too long. This class was sort of boring for me because I learned that I'm more into social psychology than personality. Also this goes over a lot of things from social psych so I wouldn't recommend taking it if you've already done it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Exams were hard and very long, short/long answer"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Slides are not super detailed, you really had to pay attention in class to do well"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is awesome! Professor Chung is one of the best professors I have had! You can tell she's very passionate about the topic and is very understanding. As for workload, the readings could take a while and when tests came I did have to study a lot to do well, but the papers were pretty easy and the tests themselves were not bad. This class is genuinely just really interesting and Prof. Chung does a good job of keeping people engaged even though it's kind of a larger lecture."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Loved this course! Professor Chung is a fantastic lecturer (I always looked forward to lectures) and very kind. Grades were based on a midterm, final, and 3 papers. As a first year in fall quarter, the papers were decently difficult, however Professor Chung and the TAs were very approachable and helpful if you needed guidance. Exams are all short answer, so it is important to study far in advance for them. Pay attention in class as oftentimes she will include key details that are not on the slides. It was a challenging course, but not impossible to get a good grade as long as you stay up to date on your work and go to office hours if you are confused. The content was very interesting and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in psychology."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I wasn't particularly as interested in personality psych as my other peers, but the lectures were still relatively enjoyable because of Prof Chung's positive energy and the fun pictures of her kids that she incorporates into her slideshows. Definitely don't take this class for granted and still have to work hard to get an A; make sure to go to office hours. All in all, would recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was really great! I learned a lot of information that can actually be applied to the real world. Professor Chung was very approachable and helpful, and was willing to answer your questions or help you with writing your essay. The class time flowed well because she structured the class nicely. The exams were very fair and covered what we learned in class, although studying did take a while. The book we had to read was also very interesting! Overall, I recommend taking this class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Loved this course. Professor Chung is amazing– it is not an easy A. The tests are difficult and require you to have a deep understanding of the material, but Professor Chung does an amazing job instructing and makes it very enjoyable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is not too hard to manage as long as you keep up with the readings and powerpoints. There is some discrepancy on grading based on the TA, however, so that is something to keep in mind. Overall it is a 200–level psychology class if you are looking for one that is not too much work."
,,,,,,,,,,,I am so thankful to have had this course in my first quarter at Northwestern to demonstrate the caliber that certain courses possess –– it was strong in virtually every sense.
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Chung is amazing. Incredibly nice and understanding. Wants you to succeed and learn. Such a fabulous lecturer. Use office hours. I didn’t and I regret it when studying. Readings are helpful but not necessary to read to succeed. Put in work on the exams and essays and it’s and A/A–. Only thing with this class is 2 exams are decently hard if you do not know your stuff. So many different points which is nice.
,,,,,,,,,,,TAKE!! THIS!! CLASS!!!!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Chung is the BEST; she makes all the lectures so fun, and she's super quick to respond and willing to help via emails and office hours. The content itself is super interesting, and Chung's lectures are absolutely fantastic – she presents everything in a logistical, coherent manner, and also shows interesting and funny videos and case studies to help us integrate the knowledge more. She is also hilarious without trying to be, and hearing stories and case studies from her time as a psychologist as applied to the content was super interesting and helped the information stick a lot better."
,,,,,,,,,,,"You do have to work hard as the essays and exams can be challenging, but studying for them was actually fun because of how engaging and stimulating this class is. Take this class with Chung, you will not regret it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Chung is AWESOME! She truly cares about the material and helping students out in office hours. 2 exams on canvas during class–time with straight–forward short answer questions. 3 papers that aren't too difficult especially if you go to office hours for help (3–4 pages each). Never too much work except when you have to study for exams and write papers, but even then it is not super time consuming or difficult."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Chung is really nice. She answers all questions and tries her best to keep lectures engaging. I love how she incorporates her children and patients' experiences into class material and lectures so we can put our learning into practice. At times, lectures can drag on, especially if there are no videos or discussions to break them up. I understand we have a lot of content to cover, though, so it can be challenging to fit in all the material with time for discussion in between. I feel like more discussion would be super helpful because I find sharing my ideas with my peers and hearing their opinions helps me form more connections from psych to my own life."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The textbook read like a flow of thoughts (not divided into modules or sections), which could be good or bad depending on how people want to study. The articles/papers we had to read were often long and did not provide much information (ex: an analysis of an aspect of personality, but there is no final determination made), but that is just psychology in general. 3 papers is doable and they're fun to write because the content is really interesting. Extra exam time is very necessary because I would not be able to finish without it. A lot of times Dr. Chung says to be as succinct as possible with our answers, but some of the content is complex, so it's hard to know how much is enough, but not too much when answering questions on exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Chung is a good teacher and her lectures are interesting. The papers are manageable, but the exams are extremely long and often took me 40–60 minutes longer after class ended."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is fantastic. As a Psych major, this was my favorite Psych course so far. Personality is already interesting, but Ching really sold this class. Chung is such an enthusiastic professor and the way she handles lectures are very engaging. I never wanted to miss a class, even though she posts the slides in case you do. After about an hour of lecture, she asks us to have a small Canvas group discussion to talk about class material we just learned, and I found this very helpful. Two exams (30 + 35%) and three papers (10 + 15 + 10%) are very manageable, and she looks at discussions in case we want our grades bumped up. She also has extra credit point days that are randomly given (and this motivates people to come to class if you didn't already love her lessons). I look forward to taking more classes from her!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great class. Professor Chung is a very engaging and enthusiastic lecturer which makes the material even more interesting. There are 3 papers, 1 midterm and 1 final, so the workload is very manageable. The only downside is the exams are all free response and long, but other than that this class was very enjoyable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"3 papers 2 tests,, tests are not multiple choice. Gives a lot of time to write papers! also gives bonus point days"
,,,,,,,,,,,The professor was great and really wanted each student to do well
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class! Super engaging and interesting and Professor Chung is great. Take this class if you have the chance – it is very interesting while also being very manageable and not a ton of work.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Chung is genuinely one of the most caring professors at NU and goes so far beyond just what she has to do as a professor. She takes time to check in on students if they aren't doing so well and provides a great support system. If you're considering taking this class, do it just to be in her class."
,,,,,,,,,,,I think that this course did well on teaching me more about people in general; I learned about the importance of personality in decision making and I can see how this knowledge would apply in the future
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS WITH CHUNG!!! She is literally the best psychology professor ever! So kind, funny, and helpful, and she makes classes really engaging and also makes an effort to get to know all of her students if you come to office hours or reach out via email. The class itself was extremely interesting, focusing on the development of personality across a person's life. There was not a lot of outside work, as there were readings but they were mostly all covered in lecture, and then 3 short papers in addition to two midterms. The grading on the midterms are fair, and its clear Chung and the TAs want to help you succeed. For anybody who is majoring or minoring in psych, or else just looking for an interesting class, I would highly recommend this class. It's by far the easiest psych class I've taken so far, and was also very engaging and intriguing!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was an amazing class and Prof Chung is a great lecturer. There was 3 papers, 1 mid term and a final. Although exams were not multiple–choice, they were very straightforward. As long as you pay attention in class and study, you can do well in the exams. The information you need for the papers are detailed and clear. It was nice that she allowed students to finish exams past class time even if you didn’t have accessibleNU."
,,,,,,,,,,,It's a great straightforward course. It provided a nice overview of psychology through the lens of personality and completely changed how I thought of personality.
,,,,,,,,,,,Enjoyable course. The professor and tas are also really helpful. Exams are super long tho
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is definitely an interesting one, although it does not go into a wide range of topics or ideas like other psychology classes do. The main focus is temperament and the Big Five, which is what we discuss most of the quarter. There aren't many assignments. The final exam is during class time on the last day, and it is not cumulative. Prof Chung is amazing. She is a great lecturer, and she is willing to help anyone with anything at any time. She is so understanding, and I highly recommend taking a class with her. The exams are all short answer, which makes them difficult at parts, but overall the exams are pretty straight forward. This is a class I would definitely recommend"
,,,,,,,,,,,An interesting class and Professor Chung is good at sustaining my interest throughout. The course consists of two exams and three essays but they do not take too long. Professor Chung was extremely kind and helpful which really aided my understanding.
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was very interesting however did not help me learn sufficiently. I found myself reviewing concepts that I had learned in previous classes and barely getting tested on material.
,,,,,,,,,,,"It turned out to be a a good course for people (like me) who haven’t taken any psychology classes before. Dr. Chung’s lectures are fun and the class teaches you a lot about yourself. The exams and essays were more difficult than I expected, but I didn’t mind. Don’t go in expecting to get As if you don’t study."
,,,,,,,,,,,"best class i've taken at NU so far. material was fascinating and Chung is by far my favorite prof at this school. she is super engaging, funny, smart, and doesn't waste any time. readings are extensive and essays and exams def require work but the material is all very interesting so didn't feel like a burden. take this class if you can!!! it made me switch my major from soc to psych."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I wish the lectures were a bit more engaging sometimes, as it's a longer class. Near the end, we would have discussion groups, but I'd like to see more group projects in this class"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Amazing Professor, will never let you fail exam simply because you run out of time. Quite possibly the best psychology professor on campus. Not a lot of homework, exams were fair"
,,,,,,,,,,,"3 essays, midterm, and a final. The final is before Thanksgiving which is nice. I thought Prof Chung was EXTREMELY nice and accommodating. She cares a lot about your wellbeing and is willing to grant extensions or help you stay on track. You can also finish exams in the hall afterward because she doesn't believe in timed exams"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class consists of 1 midterm, 1 non–cummulative final, and 3 papers. The grading for this class was harder than I expected. The exams were quite difficult, but the professor gives extra time outside of class. The papers were also quite hard, and graded harshly despite going to office hours. I would still take this class though, because the topics were very interesting and applicable to life."
,,,,,,,,,,,i loved this topic and im just really interested in personality psych.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class, especially taking it with Professor Levy Chung. It wasn't particularly difficult, though each exam was around 30 short answer questions which meant you had to really know the material in order to do well. I wouldn't call this class an easy A but it is definitely an achievable A as long as you study well for the exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course! Professor Chung is extremely kind and accommodating of extensions and absences due to illness, and she is a highly engaging lecturer. The course is reading heavy (assigning a textbook chapter and academic article after each class), but readings were rarely overwhelming. Papers were short and manageable, and the midterm and final weren't difficult as long as you study. Fair warning: if you took AP Psych in high school, this course may be a bit of a review for you. Still, I would recommend it as a very interesting intro level psych course!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"this course was very very interesting. although the 80–minute classes occasionally felt a little too long, the lectures were easy to follow and kept you engaged. i loved the applications with case studies in discussion."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a really interesting course, if you are interested at all in personality I would take it. There are 2 exams and 3 manageable papers. Prof Chung and the TAs are really helpful"
wnbg,psych,215,spring,Alissa Chung,5.51,4.92,5.11,4.58,5.34,4.84,"Prof. Chung is so nice and accommodating. She truly wants you to succeed and respond to emails super fast even on weekends. Go to her office hours for any questions on the papers and sent her your outlines. Her suggestions are very thought–provoking and helpful. We have 3 papers, 1 midterm and 1 final (exams are in form of short responses and analyzing scenarios)"
,,,,,,,,,,,"2 non cumulative exams, 3 papers– 1 is about yourself, 1 is comparing two studies, and 1 is looking at correlation between personality trait and disorder. The first is super easy. Second is super subjective– make sure your argument is solid. Third is simple enough if you find a good study. None of the readings are necessary"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good course, I took it as a distribution and enjoyed learning new things without a huge time commitment."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really liked this class but it’s not an easy A. The content is really interesting and Professor Chung is amazing but there is a lot of work for the class. There’s a midterm, final, and 3 papers"
,,,,,,,,,,,The course was very organized and engaging
,,,,,,,,,,,I thought learning about personality was really interesting. I always wanted to know more about other cultures.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Chung is great! Very interesting class, and I learned a lot. Expectations are very clearly defined. Highly recommend this class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely an enjoyable class. There’s 1 midterm, 1 final, and 3 papers due throughout the quarter. It’s all based more on lecture content than anything, so attendance is pretty important if you wanna stay on top of the information. Overall I enjoyed the content of the class and Professor Chung tries her best to make the lectures fun and engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class helped me to learn so much about personality and psychopathology. TAKE IT. The exams were difficult so make sure to study for them and go to class!
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Chung is a phenomenal lecturer and a great person. I was so genuinely absorbed by the content each class and was honestly sad to have missed class when I was sick.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The essays and tests are not entirely easy, and you do have to work quite hard to get a good grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures are super interesting but there is a lot of material to memorize. The exams are hard and sometimes the grading isn’t always consistent, especially on essays. The class is 3 essays, 2 midterms. The “final” is another midterm basically."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, this course was very effective and well–organized. Although it was a lot of content, the thorough lectures made it much easier."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Chung is WONDERFUL. I would take this class with her she makes it very interesting. I went to a lot of her office hours and she was always so kind and willing to help with anything. She took time to look over my papers and helped my understand material for the exam. She is a wonderful professor. Take this class with her!!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Chung is great! She's an engaging lecturer and more than happy to help outside of class. This class definitely isn't easy. You'll have to study a lot of midterm and final, and work hard on the papers (3 of them). But if you're interested in psych, you'll get a lot out of this class. Its really interesting and relevant!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I hope I get to take another class with Professor Chung again! I love the examples she includes in lecture and she's very skilled at explaining complicated concepts (such as how variables are controlled for, heritability, etc.). The papers (3) were each really interesting prompts, especially since you got to choose the articles you talked about in your paper as long as they aligned with the paper's prompt. Midterm and Final exams were very reflective of the lectures, as well, and I appreciated how I didn't have to worry about material from the articles/textbook popping up on the exams (articles/textbook chapters were needed to write the papers though, but I liked having the split between content we needed to know for exams and then articles to read to be able to write the paper). Overall, highly recommend this course!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Alissa is a great lecturer and the material was very interesting. However, it's definitely more challenging as psych classes go. The exams are all written–answer and the essays are graded pretty harshly, so it's important to have a better grasp of the material than you think you'll need. Still, if given the chance to go back, I would definitely take it again."
,,,,,,,,,,,"A lot of time for this class was dedicated to readings. There was also 3 essays and 2 exams, which adds up."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thoroughly enjoyed this course. Professor Levy Chung is delightful and engaging, and I generally looked forward to attending each lecture. Additionally, Professor Levy Chung is incredibly flexible and understanding, willing to provide extensions and meet with students outside of her office hours, even on days when she is working in her clinic. She provides memorable examples in class, and she truly is a good professor. The exams were manageable and based on lecture content. The three papers were also manageable, but not particularly enjoyable. They are based on articles and are essentially literature reviews with little real value. Additionally, they are graded unnecessarily harshly (coming from someone who did fairly well) because the professor and her TAs expect something mind–blowing, which is just not realistic on these papers. The first paper was the only paper that truly helped my understanding of the course because it allowed me to connect my studies to my life. Lastly, while you don't really have to read the textbook, Professor McAdams wrote it in such an eloquent way that it truly is the most enjoyable textbook I've read in my academic career."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Chung is an amazing lecturer. She uses real examples to connect to class concepts which is great. 3 papers and 2 tests which were all very manageable and graded fairly.
,,,,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot from it. The workload of the course was also manageable. There were only three short essays and two exams.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a very well–run lecture, keeping the class engaging throughout the quarter. While it did end up feeling like the topic wasn't necessarily super applicable to my field personally, I was kept engaged in the class nonetheless. It sometimes felt a bit impersonal and machine–like because it was a large lecture without a discussion, but the information was still interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I had an incredible time in the class. It goes through personality development from infancy to late adulthood and discusses the various components that make us who we are. College is a great time to learn all of these things about ourselves! Professor Levy Chung is incredibly helpful, a great lecturer, and always willing to help in whichever ways she can. The readings are well–picked and the lectures are very well–organized and exciting. I recommend reviewing material as soon and as often as you can. Exams are purely short answer recall (no multiple choice or true/false), so getting concepts down is extremely important. Additionally, make sure you start papers several days in advance. They may be short (3–4 pages per paper), but you can't bs them. Some TAs grade pretty harshly too. Ask all your questions! Overall, wonderful class if you put the work in."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good, very straight forward psych lecture. I have no background in psych and I found the content very approachable and easy to understand. Professor Chung is very nice."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really liked the material we learned but the all written exams sometimes overwhelmed me. The projects were nice and helped my understanding overall.
,,,,,,,,,,,"3 papers, two midterms. First midterm was very straightforward. Second midterm required a LOT of memorisation from the slides and was quite challenging. Papers are relatively straightforward and marking was generally tough but fair. TAs are very helpful. Prof Chung is an amazing lecturer and does a great job of engaging her students."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is definitely not an easy A, but more effort doesn't necessarily mean a higher grade either. The 3 essays take up a big part of your grade, so if you're not a good writer or a psych major, it'll be pretty difficult to get a good grade in this class. Exams are fairly easy though if you study for them and lectures are interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not the biggest fan of this class. I was very intrigued by the description of this class but honestly, if I had the choice I wouldn't take it again. The material is still interesting but the tests and essays ruined the class for me. The tests are VERY nitpicky and very hard to prepare for. It feels like Professor Chung thought of a desired answer and then tried to make an abstract question to lead to that answer. There are 2 tests and 3 essays––the essays are a little more manageable but not graded harder than I would've liked."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a great class. Prof Chung is so amazing and helpful. Definitely go to office hours and send emails if you are confused because she is always willing to explain things. The readings required for the class are often elaborated in class and it is so interesting to see how the material relates to everyday life. There are three essays and 2 exams that are all super doable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Fun class. A lot of interesting stuff and the textbook is very good. A bit of a rehash of 110 and 330, but's still good. There are 3 papers due during the quarter and 2 exams, which are 30~ short–answer questions. Exams aren't easy but possible. The prof also won't give a 100% on a paper unless it's ""above and beyond"" (you'll be a 95% if it's good). Not a super easy A, but definitely possible. If you put in enough effort, you'll probably get at least an A–"
,,,,,,,,,,,"not an easy A! don't be fooled by the intro level. takes work, showing up and taking notes, doing readings, putting effort into papers. decently interesting topic"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class. I love professor Chung. She's super understanding and helpful and will always work with you so that you can do your best despite any challenges with the material or personal issues/mental health. The class consisted of 3 papers, a midterm, and a final. Also she gives a bonus point out to anyone who shows up on a randomly selected day which is nice (basically raises your grade by 1%)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked this class a lot! Professor Chung does a great job making the content interesting, and she is super understanding of late work or missed class. The material was not particularly difficult and was all very interesting. The papers were not too difficult either, and Chung was always willing to give tips and feedback to help you write it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is interesting and Prof Chung is wonderful, but it is hard to get a good grade because the grading is pretty harsh."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Do not take this class. I am a declared psych major and this class made me want to drop it. The course evaluations are not too bad on paper: 2 non–cumulative exams and 3 papers (1 easy, 1 medium, 1 hard (its the second paper but you have a lot of time)). The papers were good and graded fairly but the exams...the grading is so nitpicky. One, it is very difficult to decipher what information to memorize because there is a lot of extra (interesting but still extra) information and in hindsight, you can't really tell what you're supposed to know because some of the questions are pretty standard and some are super specific. Chung told us to not write too much on the exams but then took off points for not including ""all parts"" on several exam questions. The fact that I wrote the exact definition of a word and only got half credit for it kind of sums up the tests. Lecture slides are not organized in a way that makes it easy to study/make a study guide because the material jumps all over the place so it's really difficult to get an overall picture. If you're a psych major, there are a ton of other classes that would be better to take to fill out the requirements. This class is not an easy A. Workload–wise, just start on the papers early and besides that you don't have to do the readings so it's really not a time killer. Ultimately, the papers were good (honestly fun!) but the overall disorganization of lectures, the nitpicky grading, and the difficulty to get an A does not make this class worth it. Drop it from the cart."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not an easy A by any means, but a pretty interesting class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Chung covers everything you need to know for tests in class. The readings are helpful if you need help fully understanding the material. Definitely go to office hours if you need help for your papers, Chung is very willing to help you develop your ideas. Since the tests are all short/essay answer (no multiple choice), you will need to put in the time to study."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was super interesting and a lot of fun! I barely took psych before this and it was a great intro to a lot of concepts. DO NOT BUY THE TEXTBOOK, you will not need it at all. I usually read the textbooks for classes and I promise you do not need it to do well on the exams, everything relevant is covered in class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was good! The teacher is great, the material was interesting, and lectures were engaging. However, it did just feel very reminiscent of developmental psych or psych 110. I don't think I learned a whole lot of anything new."
,,,,,,,,,,,"You don't need to read any of the readings aside from the ones used in the essays. There are 3 essays, they were challenging but not impossible and are easier to complete if you have fun with them. Exams were free response which seems scary but is actually super chill. My one gripe with the course is that your grade on the essays can really depend on which TA is grading them."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Chung is an absolute sweetheart but this class is not an easy A if you are looking for one. There is a lot of content we cover, and while it is really interesting it can be overwhelming! Going to office hours and staying in communication with Professor Chung and the TAs is important because the grading of papers and exams can be kind of confusing. As long as you closely follow paper and exam instructions you should do well on them. Otherwise, go to class, take good notes, and talk to Professor Chung! She is the best."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thoroughly enjoyed this class and the professor is incredible! The lectures are very interesting, and it is not too much of a time commitment. There are two exams that are not cumulative and three papers that are 3–4 pages each. If you have the opportunity, I would highly suggest taking this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class. Professor Chung is the best, lectures were very helpful. Just 2 tests and 3 papers so not too much work and very manageable as long as you go to class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty easy class, but a lot of overlap with terms that ultimately describe the same thing. That got really frustrating for the final exam. A lot of reading. Standard Northwestern workload for a Psych class. Love Chung, she explains things very well and is super understanding and accommodating. Overall decent course, and one of the better psych classes I've taken but mostly because it was Professor Chung. Any class with her is a good one."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's mostly just crazy memorization. It is mildly interesting but I feel like im not really learning, im just memorizing facts that I'll forget right after the exam. Prof is nice though."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was AWESOME. If you have any interest in what makes up someone's personality, definitely take this course. Chung is a phenomenal professor and the materials are fascinating."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Solid class, not as good as I thought it was going to be. Workload was absurd though, should be a 300 level there were 3 essays and two exams. She didn’t do anything to prepare us for the last two essays and they were graded harshly. Also not related to the content of the actual class. The exams were fine just long and a lot of writing. The material was good could get kind of tedious and gets too in the weeds."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great course, lectures can be boring at times. Exams always seem to require more time than is given."
wnbg,psych,228,fall,Sara Broaders,5.31,5.08,5.30,5.00,5.31,6.85,"great course. I thought I would hate cognitive psych but Broaders honestly taught it in a way that made it interesting and engaging. You have to do practice quizzes before the exams which are identical to the exams, so you are always well–prepared for tests. She also gives you extra credit every time you show up to class, so it's very easy to do well in the course if you put in the work. As long as you get the readings done before the exam you can work at your own pace. content is kind of difficult but easy to understand if you practice hard."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course provides a good overview of cognitive psychology. Professor Broaders is an excellent lecturer and keeps you engaged throughout. Overall, I would definitely recommend the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was very interesting but contained a substantial amount of content for one quarter. I enjoyed the material and Professor Broaders is an amazing teacher!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty good and straightforward psychology class. Professor Broaders really seems to know what she is talking about and always gave great answers for the student's questions. Not too difficult, as the practice quizzes prepare you well for the exams, and the grading is very fair. The in–class demonstrations and the ZAPS labs were very helpful to cement the course material."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was definitely a difficult and content–heavy course, but you can stay on–track by working consistently. It was interesting and intellectually challenging."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I initially enjoyed this class, but as the quarter dragged on it became less enjoyable. Part of this was because I found the latter content to be boring and I felt bogged down by the reading and practice quizzes. Another part was because the reading became more dense and difficult to comprehend at times. The 80 minutes we spent in class sometimes felt like a lifetime and because the instructor speaks so fast it was difficult to keep up. If you're genuinely interested in all aspects of cognitive psychology, then this class is for you. However, if you're just looking for an easy psych class, I would advise against this one."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely not an easy psych course, but still an engaging and interesting class that is possible to do well in. There are three non–cumulative midterms that are curved and a cumulative final. Your lowest exam grade is dropped, and this can be the final, so if you have an A after the third exam, you can skip the final. The material is very technical – you do have to know specific experiments, specific problems/fallbacks with different theories, etc. It's not like other psych classes where you can learn the vague underlying principles and wing the exams based on your intuition. Even though this course required a little work, I think it's still pretty easy to do well in, since most exam questions come from the practice textbook quizzes and practice FRQs and Broaders offers multiple opportunities for extra credit. If you go into the class willing to do the work, you'll be fine, and Broaders' enthusiasm and knowledge makes it all worth it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a lot of work. Prof. Broaders runs the class in a way where she expects you to learn material from both the lectures and textbook, but you would never know how much the textbook would be emphasized in the midterms, so you had to know both like the back of your hand. The volume of material that you are expected to know in such a short amount of time is staggering; it can be very easy to fall behind. If you are taking any other time consuming class, this class is not going to help. I think the topics were interesting, but the textbook explains them in the worst and most confusing way possible, causing me to spend hours trying to figure out what they are referring to. however, even though there is a lot of material, Professor Broaders is a great lecturer. She makes the 80 min lectures engaging, and she offers extra credit for during every lecture for showing up. I think this would be a good class if some of the material was cut out because I felt that I just memorized information for the midterms, but never had time to really learn it."
,,,,,,,,,,,Loved the lectures and not too much outside of class work
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course. I thought it was very interesting, especially learning about mental rotations and problem–solving. Learning about memory was really helpful because it allowed me to think more critically about how I study. I specifically wanted to take this course because Professor Broaders was teaching it this quarter. Professor Broaders has very engaging lectures and I really love her course policies. She allows you to drop one of your exam scores, so if you do well enough on the midterms you do not have to take the final. The grading consisted of Zap Lab online assignments, a short paper, practice exams, and exams. Professor Broaders gave a lot of extra credit for attending the lectures and made it clear that she wanted all of us to do well. It was not hard to do well, and the content felt very relevant."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Broaders does a great job teaching this class and I'd definitely recommend taking it as a major/minor requirement (or even a distro if the topic interests you). It certainly isn't an easy A, but I learned so much in the course and it exceeded my expectations coming into the class. Professor Broaders is an engaging lecturer and the way she structures her teaching makes learning more enjoyable and studying easier. For example, she includes several participation opportunities in each class, which provides lots of examples of concepts and material (you also get .5 extra credit points with every class you attend, which is a bonus). You're graded on 4 exams (although the lowest grade drops, so you could skip the final if you have a satisfactory grade prior) and a short paper. The only qualms I had with this class were that I felt the short paper was unnecessary (but definitely manageable) and that the textbook and lectures sometimes didn't align. Professor Broaders often lectured about her own content in class and the corresponding textbook chapters covered slightly different material, but we were still tested on both concepts. This didn't make studying that much harder –– it was just slightly inconvenient and means you have to do textbook reading pretty thoroughly. Other than that, I think this is a great opportunity to fulfill the ""cognitive/neuroscience"" column of the psych major/minor or a social/behavioral sciences distro."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm going to let this incident speak for itself: in a lecture on attention, Dr. Broaders wanted to make a point that, if a stimulus is important enough to you, you can devote your attentional resources solely on that and ignore the information your brain (and thus, you) deem unimportant or unworthy. She then proceeded to turn on ""Take On Me"" by A–ha, playing over the speakers in the giant lecture hall, and continued to lecture for 10 more slides. A student said they couldn't hear what had been said in the past 10 slides, and she basically did not summarize any of what had been covered. I've (foolishly) taken courses with Dr. Broaders before, so I can testify that this sort of incident (though no other example is this egregious) is not without company. There are plenty of other times she did or said things to make neurodivergent/disabled/mentally ill students feel alienated and unwelcome. And because Dr. Broaders is the Director of Undergraduate Studies in the department and is so intimately involved with undergraduate advising, no one in their right mind is going to file a formal complaint against her. I guess my advice is if you are neurodivergent or disabled in any way... please do yourself a favor and take this course with literally any other professor."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really loved this course! Professor Broaders is an amazing lecturer and made this material super interesting to learn. We talked about memory, learning, language, problem solving, and judgment, just to name a few. The exams aren't exactly easy, but if you come to class and read the textbook, you should be fine. After this course, I am even more interested in cognitive psychology and excited to learn more."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course was really interesting throughout, and I feel like I have a better understanding of psychology as a whole after the course, as well as an interest in further classes in the field. I think the practice quizzes are really helpful for learning the materials, and there are a lot of resources to help you succeed in the class. There is some studying to be done for each of the midterms, but honestly they're just normal tests and aren't too difficult to do well on if you come to class everyday and pay attention to the lectures. Reading the required materials is also pretty important for the test, since a lot of the test questions are taking information from the books. A lot of the questions are also from the practice quizzes, so reviewing is really helpful in this class to do well on tests."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was super interesting! You can really tell that the instructors want you to succeed as there are a bunch of opportunities for extra credit. In addition to that, the workload was pretty manageable (although the readings were a little long). You also don't have to take the final if you do well on the three midterms (they give you a lot of resources to succeed so you'll do fine if you study)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is an amazing class, I highly recommend it if you're interested in neuro or just want to dig deeper into how people think. Professor Broaders is an exceptional instructor– the exams are challenging, but you will learn so much and get a lot out of this class if you put in the effort."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved the readings and lectures for this class. I also preferred the new schedule (3 midterms and 1 essay) to Broaders' old schedule (2 midterms and 3 smaller essays). Broaders is an excellent lecturer and gives students ample opportunity and resources to succeed in her classes. I highly recommend this class to psych students, whether or not they have much interest in cognitive psychology. I went in with low expectations, but this ended up being my favorite class of the quarter by far. Really fascinating material."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Content is interesting, and the course is structured the same as many other courses taught by Prof. Broaders. The only thing I didn't really like is how the lectures and textbooks didn't overlap much. A lot of textbook information was not covered in lecture, but some lecture material also wasn't covered in the textbook. The exams would test both, as well as material from another book (Make it Stick, regarding learning strategies etc.), which made the content feel a bit scattered. Otherwise, the course isn't too difficult, and definitely manageable as long as you generally keep up and go to lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is really rewarding but it is also one of the more difficult psychology courses I've taken so far. I really enjoyed Professor Broader's lectures and found the content really interesting, but the course moves fast and there is a lot of material covered in a short amount of time. That being said it isn't too hard to do well if you put the work in, there's extra credit and her policy of dropping your lowest exam grade is super helpful."
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this class. Professor Broaders is a great lecturer and I learned a lot. The exams weren't too difficult and she drops your lowest exam score. There are also lots of extra credit opportunities. I was always excited to go to this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Broaders is awesome. There is a lot of opportunity to improve your grade. Easy online assignments that take about 10 minutes, once or twice a week and as long as you do them on time and try your best you will earn an 100%. (10%). Online practice quizzes that you can take as many times as you want. As long as you eventually earn an 80%, you earn an 100% in that category. (10%). An essay that you write about how to study effectively, based on the book we read. As long as you actually put time into the essay and cover topics from each chapter you will do well (10%). Exams are 70% of your grade. 3 noncumulative midterms and 1 final exam that is cumulative. Lowest exam grade gets dropped. Extra credit opportunities just from attending class will increase your exam scores significantly. One extra credit question on each exam that is not related to the material and is pretty easy. Exams are curved, not by much because most students do well. She makes it very possible to succeed in the course. Class attendance is MANDATORY, you will be lost if you do not attend class. Textbook readings are required as well. If you read the textbook, attend class, and do not procrastinate you will do well. A lot of memorization is required. I have an A– (have not taken the final yet but my grade can technically only improve/stay the same). Professor Broaders keeps class interesting and it went by quickly. A very enjoyable course, but you will need to put in the work. It was a wonderful course to take my freshman year first quarter because it taught me how to study more effectively and she clearly wants everyone to succeed!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed that this class taught me more about myself as a student, and what works and does not for me. I found that for the most part the content that I learned was interesting and I liked that I was able to apply what I learned in the class almost immediately."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Broaders is a great lecturer. The class was always really interesting and interactive. There are three non–cumulative midterms and a cumulative final exam, but the lowest test grade is dropped. There is one paper based on readings in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class. The topics are very interesting and I was engaged in every lecture. I learned a lot of interesting content, some of which I even use and talk about outside of class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Be prepared to work and stay on top of assignments. Start studying early. Really interesting class and Prof. Broaders makes it really enjoyable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is extremely content heavy. We pretty much cover a new chapter each lesson, and there are often supplementary lectures to watch the week before each midterm (we have 3 midterms for this class) which takes up a lot of time outside of the lectures themselves. However, Professor Broaders makes the class quite interactive and hence engaging, whether it be through the ZAPs assignments or the extra credit activities. Speaking of which, we have extra credit activities for almost every class, and these can help boost our grade quite a bit, and I honestly think that it's a pretty smart way to ensure attendance throughout the quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class material is easy to understand and interesting to learn, but the professor makes the course way harder than it needs to be. No leniency in terms of extensions or absences. This feels like one of those classes where they act like this is the only class you're taking.... and more often than not you are watching another 30 mins of lecture at home to cover material before exams. Also seems like the professor exhibited some racial biases. Overall, recommend taking the course if you like psychology, but with a different instructor."
,,,,,,,,,,,Written response question on the exam are toughly graded in my opinion. MCQ were not bad. I love the way Broaders teaches and engages with the class.
,,,,,,,,,,,Cool course but if you're not interested in the topic it might get boring
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was class was lowkey pretty hard. It's literally 10 chapters of reading crammed into 10 weeks so it's a ton of information, and you need to know information from the book and from lecture. She goes really fast in lecture so you have to really pay attention. If you take good notes (like literally write down everything) and stay on top of reading you'll probably be fine, but if this class isn't your first priority I would not expect to get an A in this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was very challenging, but I truly learned so much. Professor Broaders is very demanding when it comes to course load and I would say that this class is far from an easy A, but if you are interested in psychology, you will definitely enjoy the content of the course. There are a lot of extra credit opportunities, but the exams are very difficult. I would recommend going to office hours if you can."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class presents very interesting topics about the cognitive mind, but it is a lot of reading. Once you get behind on reading the textbook chapters, it takes a lot of time to catch back up. The exams are pretty easy as long as you read the textbook and do the practice problems."
,,,,,,,,,,,fine
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is incredibly interesting and is so satisfying when you understand the theories that researchers have developed to understand the mind and cognition better. The tests were fair and reflected what we were expected to know from the lectures. Prof. Broaders always made it clear what we were in charge of understanding for exams, of which there were three midterms and a final – if we did well on the three midterms, we did not have to take the final (which is what I did). Reading the textbook was actually engaging most times and the examples given were straightforward and easily interpretable since we see how these processes of cognition play out in our lives every day if we are aware."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a great course –– incredibly interesting –– but definitely not an easy A if that is what you are looking for.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Psych 228 with Broaders will make you learn a ton. The class is taught at a fast pace where it feels as if you are studying for an exam every other week (there are 4 of them!). However, you get extra credit for showing up to lectures and they are very engaging. The textbook and zaps labs are fantastic resources. Exams consist of a mixture of multiple choice and free response questions, but I would say the free response questions are graded rather harshly. However, the harsh grading is counteracted by lenient grading on labs and practice quizzes (as well as extra credit), creating a fair grading experience. With proper study habits and showing up to lecture a B+/A– is really achievable."
wnbg,psych,228,winter,David Rapp,5.60,5.21,5.29,4.92,5.97,3.78,"Professor Rapp is a great lecturer. Even though I did not think I was going to find the cognitive aspect of psych interesting, his teaching style made it interesting and engaging. 3 exams FRQ exams and 2 one page research report. Exams are pretty doable if you attend lecture and take good notes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Rapp is a great prof, though he does lecture quickly and going to class is a must (since he doesn't include much info on the slides). If you have any interest in the subject, the workload is manageable—3 exams, 2 papers"
,,,,,,,,,,,Rapp is awesome take this class with him! I'm super interested in the subject so I found his lectures really funny and engaging. 3 midterms are kinda hard but nothing crazy and 2 fairly simple research reports. Have to take good notes tho because he doesn't put a whole lot on the slides.
,,,,,,,,,,,"very easy class, go to class and you will be more than fine. The labs mentioned are very interesting and he cleary is very passionate about cog psych. overall great 200 level course, just wish it challenged me a little bit more"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Rapp is such a great lecturer and lessons will definitely last in my memory! Wasn't expecting to like cog psych at all, but Rapp definitely made this class great for me."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a pretty straightforward lecture class. I would mostly recommend it to 1st or 2nd years who are just getting into psych. As a third–year psych major, the class content was pretty repetitive from what I learned in other psych classes, although it's interesting by itself still. Prof. Rapp is a great lecturer with energy, enthusiasm, and humor. You just have to be able to take good notes and follow the lectures closely even though they're kinda fast and you should be set, the textbook isn't necessary. The only assignments aside from exams are two research reports which are just one page and extremely easy."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course provides an excellent introduction to the discipline of cognitive psych. Professor Rapp is passionate, energetic and great at explaining concepts. I thoroughly enjoyed the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was interesting, Professor Rapp was funny and engaging. Assignments were 3 exams which were open book but still fairly challenging and 2 one page research reports on a paper of your choosing. While attendance isn't taken and slides are posted, I definitely recommend going to class because context is important and the slides do not contain all the information, a lot of important stuff he says aloud!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Rapp does a great job choosing and presenting content. Good intro class. A little more challenging than expected with time crunched exams
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really liked the content of the course and the professor but I didn't like how it was graded. We had 1.5 hr take home exams and although I knew the content well, it was hard to complete all of the questions and the rubric was very harsh. Also, you pretty much can't miss a lecture – you'll miss tons of info and essential content for the exams that you can't get just from the slides. This is not an easy class, but the content is interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Rapp is amazing! He does a great job at making the course interesting and fun! There are 5 assignments total, 2 short papers and 3 exams so it is not too much work. Overall I really enjoyed this class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Rapp is very helpful and he makes jokes during lectures and has some interactive aspects to demonstrate topics, which helps when this class is so early in the morning. Good class, however, grade is based on 3 exams (non cumulative) and 2 research reports and no extra credit, so don't mess up on any exam too badly."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Rapp is very knowledgeable and passionate about cognitive psychology, and that is a testament to his teaching. Make sure you study in advance for the exams! Even just skimming the textbook and reviewing the lecture slides can go a long way."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was good at covering the basics and Prof. Rapp was very engaging but sometimes the content was boring and redundant based on things that I encountered in previous psych classes.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I am super glad I took this class with Professor Rapp. He is an engaging lecturer and delivers content well. I think the test format can be a lot to bite off sometimes, so if your strength is not short–answer tests it might be tricky. Pay attention in lecture and write everything down and you will only have to use the textbook supplementarily."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really loved this class! Not necessarily an easy A, but Professor Rapp is just excellent and really wants his students to succeed. Lectures are engaging and interesting, and courseload is not terribly heavy. Go to lecture, follow instructions carefully, study early on for exams, and you'll do well. The subject matter is not always groundbreaking per se, but the research we talk about is always interesting and really cool insights are raised in almost every lecture."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course. I appreciated the study guides provided for each midterm, and I thought the exams were fair and manageable (although I did feel pressed for time on the midterms). The instruction was engaging,"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Rapp is definitely the best to take this class with! The notoriously feared column B, and he made this class much more durable. There were three non–cumulative midterms with two research reports. All the exams were open–note and administered over Canvas. My own issue with the exam was that the exams were 100 points, 5 open–ended questions, each with 4–5 parts. It never felt like there was enough time to type out a sufficient answer, let alone to go back and check my answers. The research reports were also somehow very stressful for me, despite only being 1 page double–spaced. Overall, I still think I had a good time, and I would not have asked for anybody else to have taken this class with. He is super kind, approachable, and knowledgeable in the field. Definitely go to his office hours – he is super helpful!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"All the Column B classes seemed boring to me for the Psychology requirements, but Professor Rapp makes Cognitive Psychology really fun and engaging. I love the video clips he shows, his ENTHUSIASM!!, and his HUMOR ohmigosh! Professor Rapp definitely knows how to make classes not a drag. For the tests, definitely make sure you understand the material and can talk and teach to other people the concepts. You could probably get away with not taking notes on the textbook readings but they definitely help and accompany the lecture material. Would definitely recommend this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course— I am a psychology major, and it was one of my favorite psychology courses I've taken at NU so far. Topics covered are super interesting, ranging from visual perception to language learning to decision–making and reasoning. Professor Rapp is an incredibly engaging professor— I really enjoyed our lectures. Tests and research reports are manageable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is great! I was kind of scared to take it, seeing as I'm not a STEM person, but Prof Rapp is hilarious and witty and such an engaging lecturer that even the most difficult of concepts were fun to learn about. The research reports were awesome assignments–– just one page long, and graded very fairly. The three exams were challenging, especially given the amount of writing that you have to do within the time limit, but them being open–book was beyond helpful. You really do need to go to class in order to do well on the exams–– Prof Rapp says a lot of stuff during lecture that aren't on the slides (the slides are pretty bare by themselves, tbh) and the book readings don't always mention the specific examples you'll need to know for exams. I skipped class a few times just because it was an early class, and immediately regretted it when it came time to take the exams. All in all, a pretty straightforward class with a great professor!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"i really liked the professor and the way the course was taught, but i am just not a big fan of cognitive psychology. the tests were okay – you have to really understand the content and have good notes to do well. you need to attend every lecture to understand the material. i still enjoyed this course because of professor rapp – don't take cognitive psychology if you are not interested in it with another professor."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Rapp was such an awesome professor. He's so knowledgable and extremely engaging in class. The workload was not bad at all and he was a very fair grader for the two 1 page papers we had. The exams are a little tedious, but as long as you take good notes in class, you will be fine"
,,,,,,,,,,,This was an overall really good course. Professor Rapp is an engaging and effective lecturer and the material is interesting. It's very manageable (3 exams and 2 research reports) and has applicable material. I took it for psych col b requirement and was pleasantly surprised.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class (a lot more than I expected to)! Prof Rapp is a great lecturer – really clear, engaging, and uses a lot humor. The lectures go at a relatively fast pace, but it was not hard to follow. The class also focuses a lot on reviewing major research studies in cognitive psychology, which I found very interesting. The exams are open notes, but you still need to know all the concepts pretty well to do well in the exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"good class, not too much work, professor rapp is an engaging lecturer so class isn't too boring. three open–note exams and two short research reports."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought the lectures were really compelling and engaging. The exams were tough, but helped you really think about information."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Rapp is one of my favorite Psychology professors at Northwestern. I much preferred social and personality psych before taking this class, so I was nervous this was going to be a bit dry, but Rapp made this class enjoyable and much more interested in cognition as a whole. The class is very straight forward, three non cumulative exams that are open note and two research reports that were one page. The readings are easy to understand and not too textbook–y. 10/10 class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,this course provided a great introduction to cognitive psychology
,,,,,,,,,,,"David Rapp is an 11/10 instructor. If you get to take a psychology class, you are lucky if you get Rapp. Unlike a lot of professors at Northwestern he is a human first and a teacher second. On the first day of class he properly introduced himself and his upbringing and connected a lot of psychology concepts to himself throughout the course. In this way, he makes the content seem both personal and applicable. As an instructor he is clear, engaging, interesting, funny, and relatable. He teaches at a good pace and he makes use of experiments in class. Definitely take this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The textbook readings aren't absolutely necessary to get an A, but it does help support comprehension of lecture content and gives loads of examples that're useful to do super well on exams. Exams were take home, so not stressful at all, and the only other graded assignments are two research reports which require little effort. David Rapp is really funny and engaging as a professor, would take a class with him again."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Class is really interesting and Rapp is a really good lecturer. A decent amount of reading, most of the grade is from 3 exams and the other part is from two research reports which aren't too bad."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Rapp is awesome. He's so knowledgeable and funny and makes lectures a lot more entertaining, especially when they're early in the morning. Lectures are essentially mandatory because some key information isn't on the slides, and Professor Rapp only mentions them in lecture. He incorporates a lot of research studies into his lectures, and it's hard to understand the methods/results without listening to him explain them live. 3 exams, all online on Canvas, all open note. Each exam is open response."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take cog psych with Rapp! He makes every lecture so engaging, interesting, and easy to follow with his jokes and connections to real world situations. The workload was very manageable, and the three exams were open note which was very nice"
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR RAPP!! < literally the best class to get that column B requirement for all my psych baddies. prof rapp is one of the best lecturers i've had at nu – he's so good at breaking down complex concepts in ways that are easy to understand, but he's also SO FUNNY. your grade is based on 2 short research reports (1 page each) + 3 non–cumulative open–note exams. the exams are kinda hard since they're short essay, so make sure to budget your time wisely! overall i'm so glad i took this course and i would highly recommend even to non–psych majors!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"A good class overall. Show up and take good notes and you should be good for the tests. For this quarter, they were all online synchronous and open–note, although he implied that this isn't always the case. Getting your grade up is difficult because there are only like five grades in the whole class, so really study for the exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As long as you look at the study guides you will do fine. The class is easy, but the tests are such a time crunch."
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof. Rapp is AMAZING! He is a good lecturer and makes everything interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Lectures were long but incredibly engaging. Rapp is a great professor who knows the content well. The papers are easy to get 100% so helps the grade. Although exams are open note, the time crunch makes them incredibly difficult. Not an easy A class, but loved Professor Rapp nonetheless. You will lean a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a great class! Professor Rapp is a fantastic lecturer who presents the material in a very concise and engaging way. The class consists of 3 non–cumulative exams and 2 research reports. Overall this is a great class and is not too difficult.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is AWESOME. Prof Rapp is super cool, and explains stuff really well. The tests are 5 essay questions, but they're completely open note, and really not that difficult. The content is really really interesting, definitely take this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof. Rapp is a very dynamic and energetic lecturer. He's a funny guy and his lectures are quite engaging. The tests can be a bit frustrating but they are open note so it makes sense that the questions can be a bit tricky. Overall it's a great psychology class and introduction to cognitive psych.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great course. Rapp is an awesome professor and communicates ideas super well and in an engaging way. I wasn't particularly interested in the topic, but the lectures were solid. Tough grading for exams, but they were all online."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As someone who is not super interested in cognitive psychology, the content was not always the most engaging. Professor Smith is very prepared and knows what he is talking about. Take home tests are hard! much harder than you expect"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Rapp is honestly a beacon of light in the psych department. Please take this class with him. He took a bunch of material that normally I would have found super boring and got me to think about it outside of class time. Truly a legend and I will miss him dearly. His open note exams aren’t a joke, but if you go to class and fill out the study guide carefully, you will get an A. Don’t blow off this class – it goes fast! BTW – chug two coffees before every class. Rapp is amazing, but he talks at the speed of light."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class. Cog psych is really cool and Rapp does a great job keeping it palatable and interesting
,,,,,,,,,,,"dr rapp is great: super entertaining, nice, and overall fun to learn from. I didn't want to take this class because I thought It was going to be super intense, but it wasn't. dr Rapp's teaching style makes the material easier to learn. the exams were hard and took a lot of time, but they were open note which took some pressure off. I ended up enjoying this class much more than I expected to and would recommend it"
,,,,,,,,,,,"A lot of reading, but pretty interesting topic & material. Unfortunately, Prof. Rapp was very quick to accuse students of plagiarism –– accused a friend of mine of plagiarizing an assignment, docked her a ton of points (she's now not sure if she'll be able to pass the class), and she had to go through the whole process with an integrity committee, which found that she had not plagiarized at all, which she had told him multiple times. He didn't give her the points back and the process of defending herself against academic dishonesty took a large toll on her. Very frustrating all around, and Prof. Rapp needs to do a better job of not being so quick to accuse students, because those are serious accusations and have large effects."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was interesting and Professor Rapp does do a good job of explaining things. His slides are pretty useless, you can't really use them to study. His lectures are not recorded and I would not recommend missing any lectures. The exam questions are very detailed and sometimes difficult to answer: in lecture Professor Rapp speaks very colloquially and explains concepts very simply, and it can be difficult to translate those concepts into more academic terms for the exam."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very solid course. Took it after taking intro psych the year before and found there to be some overlap, but also some new material, and even the overlapping content was covered in more detail. Rapp is an outstanding lecturer – he managed to create the perfect balance of content and humor to keep me engaged even at 9:30 AM (and I am NOT a morning person). This is the type of class where you can either do the readings OR go to class (for the most part, and Rapp notes the rare occasions when topics are only covered in the textbook), and you should definitely choose the latter. Take thorough notes, as lectures are not recorded, and exams will ask you to explain concepts in a fair amount of detail. Workload is minimal – 2 one–page research reports and 3 exams (open–note, though I'm not sure how long that will continue."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great course, professor Rapp was an amazing professor. Very engaging class and I enjoyed it. The class lecture was crucial to go to, and assessments were very fair."
wnbg,psych,228,spring,William Horton,5.17,4.94,5.11,4.64,5.89,4.10,"Good, interesting class with only two assignments that were very straightforward and easy (just summaries of research papers). 2 midterms and a final, all non–cumulative and he gives a list of all the topics+examples/studies that will be on it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"solid. not too hard, 3 exams, one is the final, if you study you'll be fine. just like –– study"
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof Horton is a great professor. The layout of the class is super manageable with 3 non–cumulative exams. The material is super interesting too!
,,,,,,,,,,,prof horton is great!!! take this class for your b column req! the expectations are super clear and the course isn't very hard to do well in even if you dont read the book. just go to class and go over the study guide of concepts and you can be successful!
,,,,,,,,,,,"3 exams were pretty hard but no homework, dense material so important to study but professor horton is really nice"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This isn't an easy psych course, but Professor Horton is very reasonable and approachable, and his explanations are clear. As long as you're on top of lecture notes and have a good grasp of the topics before the exams, it's manageable to get a good grade overall."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Taking this class with Horton made me realize how interesting cog psych is! I always felt well–prepared for the exams because of the study guides, and every question was fairly written and understandable"
,,,,,,,,,,,3 tests and 2 papers. make sure to do well on tests because there isn't much room to make up for lower scores
,,,,,,,,,,,an average column b course for psych majors.
,,,,,,,,,,,study guides are so helpful in reviewing lecture material. pay attention in lecture and do the study guide and you'll be chilling on exams. not too hard to get an A and a very interesting class
,,,,,,,,,,,"Enjoyed this class, definitely a lot of pure memorization. I was really interested going into the class, a little disappointed we didn't do much on decision making, but found the conten tinteresting."
,,,,,,,,,,,Lectures were boring and hard to get through
,,,,,,,,,,,"chill class, grade depends on 3 non–cum exams and 2 one–page summary of research. The class is interesting sometimes and I enjoyed more than I expected."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a pretty nice, chill class. The lectures though long and full of lots of information, were not too bad. The exams were ok. Its very easy to get some multiple questions wrong and since they are each 2 points, I think its very challenging to get an A. But I'm glad I took this class because it was a nice break between my other bulky classes. This class had no homeework besides 2 research reports so I liked it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a fairly easy column B class, because the outside coursework was really minimal. The textbook was not necessary to read, and aside from that the assignments were two short research reports (which are more just like summaries of other research) and 3 exams, which if you follow his study guide for and truly study hard, you can do well on. The class itself was not the most interesting class I've taken, but that also could be that it's just not the area of psych I am interested in. Horton was extremely kind and understanding, and always available for help outside of class as well as being super responsive to emails. Overall, if you need a column B class that isn't too much of a hard class, I would recommend 228 with Horton."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I had heard this class was super boring, however it was actually pretty interesting! The class definitely requires work, but if you dedicate yourself to the class it is manageable to do very well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a good column B requirement course for the psych major/minor. Lectures could get a little long, but that tends to be the nature of the content if you are not already interested in this topic. Prof. Horton is very communicative and happy to help out if you have questions. The class has three midterms and two research reports. There is not much work outside of class other than preparing for these. The midterms are fair (make sure to go through the study guide he puts out), but require a good amount of preparation. Overall, it was a pretty good class, and Prof. Horton is a good professor to take it with."
,,,,,,,,,,,love professor horton. he's very nice and a good lecturer. he does talk pretty fast and doesn't allow us enough time to grasp the harder concepts. workload was light until exams which required a lot of studying.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very interesting course content, but exams, especially multiple choices, are harder than I think."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Horton is wonderful. His tests can be hard so paying attention to lectures and studying is necessary. However, interesting material and again Professor Horton is a great lecturer. You will do as well as the amount of time you put into it!"
,,,,,,,,,,,The Class was overall pretty straightforward. Three total tests all of which there was no time pressure at all. The two research papers were also pretty easy to complete so long as you choose a good article to write it on.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good course. 3 exams and 2 papers were graded fairly. Like any psych class, there are a ton of terms and content on the exams. The provided study guide is basically everything on the slides and most of the chapters. Don't wait to get the study guide before starting your exam review."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Horton is a great lecturer, I enjoyed learning about the basics of Cognitive Psychology in his class as he is very knowledgeable. There were three exams and 2 research reports in this class, so the work load is pretty manageable overall. A good intro to Cognitive Psychology course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course definitely helped me learn! Professor Horton's lectures were wonderful and easy to understand. His slides went into sufficient detail without being chaotic and the textbook for the class was a great resource for additional clarifications. His exams were also structured nicely as there was multiple choice and 6 free response questions. None of the questions ever felt unfair and if you understood the concepts and examples of concept application, you would do great. I also fell sick his quarter and missed some lectures and the first exam. Professor Horton was one of my most understanding, kind professors. He allowed me to make up the assignment I had missed with sufficient time to catch up. I was also given a makeup exam and was encouraged to reach out with any questions about content I had missed. I never felt the class to be overwhelming and enjoyed learning (even though class was earlier than what I usually enjoy lol). Definitely take this class with Professor Horton if you can!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is heavily lecture based and the lectures are super dense. There's a lot of information and sometimes you're just typing whatever is on the slides, and it can be hard to focus. Sometimes I'm not sure if coming to class was necessary but I always did. Horton is a dry lecturer and is good about answering questions after class, but don't ask too many questions then or during office hours cause then he'll just make you feel bad about not knowing things (which doesn't make any sense). You can get through it if you just make quizlets based on all the slides and making sure you really understand everything on them."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, a very straightforward class! Take it with Horton if you don't want a lot of work / a not too hard Column B requirement. There are 3 exams every ~6 lectures or so with 2 extra one–page research papers where you summarize a study. Horton is pretty chill and it's nice that he gives a study guide with key terms every exam. I will say, 3 exams can be a lot sometimes, just in terms of having the same stamina to study for each one. Also, Horton gets quieter as he speaks sometimes, so I would recommend sitting in the front to properly hear him. His tests are also fine; there are just some questions that can be tricky, but you should be able to get an A/A–."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall this was a solid course. Although Professor Horton lectures in a bit of a monotone, you could always tell that he was passionate about the content and his students' learning, so that energy was contagious. Professor Horton assigned 2 one–page research reports during the quarter and had 3 non–cumulative exams which were easy if you took notes in class and studied beforehand. This course has a lot of content, but it's always manageable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I found lectures a bit dull at times, but this class was pretty decent overall."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course covered a ton of content, non of which was particularly difficult but the sheer volume made it trickier. 3 non–cumulative exams and 2 research reports. Make sure you really study for the exams because they are long, 32 MC and 6 essay questions each. If you put in the work you will do fine"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked that the course was not overly demanding. You could probably get by with not doing the readings. However, there was a lot of content covered during each class period, so it felt overwhelming a lot of the time. Additionally, Professor Horton has the tendencies to use very detailed, scientific knowledge while explaining, so it made it difficult to understand the material at times."
,,,,,,,,,,,Love Horton!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! One of the best psych professors there is
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class! Three non–cumulative MC/FR exams (really not bad: a quizlet and studying ~24 hrs ahead does the trick) and two very short research summary reports. Lecture topics are really very cool, would recommend this class to anyone with any interest. It's low stress, Horton does a great job, and the extra materials used in lecture are very interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Interested topics. Two short research reports, and three exams. I was a bit disappointed in that I feel that vast majority of the curriculum of this course is identical to Intro Psych. It doesn't go in depth about topics unique to cognitive psychology. So if you took intro psych a bonus is this course will be a breeze, but you won't learn too much more. Everything you need to know is covered in lectures and put on the study guides, so it's structured in a way conducive to learning all the material. Some of the lectures were a bit dull. Overall I liked the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Three midterms that are multiple choice and short answer. The short answer are grades pretty easy just be careful about time. Other than studying before the exams and doing the 2 research reports (took about 1.5 hours each) I did not do any readings or any work outside of lecture. Easy, chill class and prof Horton is rly fair and let us out early several days."
,,,,,,,,,,,THis class is a pretty standard psych class. If you’re not into cognitive psych it’s hard to digest other than that it’s good and straight forward. Exams are far but do require a fair amount and time dedicated to study
,,,,,,,,,,,It was engaging and also digestible in the form of content and progression.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great psych class. Sid is a strong lecturer and the class content was very interesting and engaging. The exams cover a lot of material, but if you take the time to study you can definitely get an A. The slides can be confusing without additional context, so make sure you go to class."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course has unnecessarily challenging tests. The tests were very abstract so studying just the slides was not helpful. The class was very interesting; even though the lectures can feel a bit long. Professor Horton is very approachable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class isn't to bad, but it is exam heavy. 300 of the 350 points are exams. Also, each exam covers all the material in that unit so make sure you know key experiments/words and are able to apply them."
,,,,,,,,,,,Really well taught with low stress. Only 3 non cumulative exams and 2 small research reports. Take this class with Prof Horton!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Horton is a great lecturer and his lessons are very interesting. If you don't like lectures that are just people talking, he may not be the professor for you. But, if you are into the kind of lectures where you sit down, they lecture, show videos occasionally and provide very straightforward material to work with, he is a great professor for this class. His exams were hefty and contained literally ALL the material they could have with regards to the material in lectures, but if you put in enough time and effort into studying, the class is definitely doable. I don't think the class is an easy A, but it's easy enough where you can definitely get anywhere between a B and an A depending on how much time you put into it (max 4 hours for exam studying)."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was pretty easy in the sense that all of the information is there and accessible via lectures and the textbook. Lectures can be quite redundant if you read the textbook before hand but the studies in class and additional info in the book make giving attention to both important.
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is pretty straightforward; exams are not too bad as long as you study the slides. Overall workload is very manageable and the content is interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,Loved Professor Horton! Breaks up the class into three tests (non–cumulative) and two one page research summaries. Was super accommodating when I needed to take a test late or whenever people needed help in the class. Tests were very clear and mapped directly onto lecture content.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm much more interested in the social side of psych, so this class was pretty uninteresting but manageable. 3 non cumulative exams and 2 1–page papers summarizing recent research in cognitive psych."
,,,,,,,,,,,loved the prof. exams required a lot of memorization but if you study and pay attention during lecture you'll do well. 3 non–cumulative exams and 2 one–page research papers. prof goes through lectures really fast and loads on lots of material but it was all pretty interesting
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class was decent overall. It covered a lot of terms, perhaps more than one can comfortably handle. The exams were fair but they didn't solely rely on memorization from slides, but instead required applying the material to real–life examples. The exam format consisted of 32 multiple–choice questions and 6 short answer questions. The subject matter itself was interesting, but the exams could be overwhelming due to the sheer amount of terms that needed to be memorized. Nevertheless, with proper preparation, such as studying early and seeking clarification through asking questions, one can successfully navigate through the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was pretty interesting and not too hard if you study for the exams. You don't need to do the required reading, but if you really want to he puts the important pages on the study guides."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is really interesting because you get to learn the psychology behind everyday things you don't normally think about. Professor Horton is great at explaining concepts!
,,,,,,,,,,,Good and engaging lectures. Textbook readings go well with the lectures. Tests are quite fair along with the grading. There could be more helpful study materials like a practice test but the study guides were still helpful.
wnbg,psych,244,fall,Leoandra Rogers,5.32,5.14,4.61,4.18,5.13,4.33,"This course is super interesting since it relates to something we've all experienced (being kids) but the work definitely became tedious at times. We don't have any exams which was nice and the discussion questions each week aren't very difficult. The hardest part was probably just all of the readings, especially from the textbook; you don't have to read the textbook and take notes like I did but it feels kind of necessary if you're trying to get all of the key terms and theories to reference in your writing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class, easy and interesting. Prof Rogers is a great lecturer. Downside i'd say is that the material can feel a bit repetitive."
,,,,,,,,,,,mehhhhhh – I really liked the topics but lectures were SO boring that I just stopped going completely. prof is nice but just hard to sit through lectures. assignments were fair I would say. Not an easy A but definitely doable depending on your TA. No exams which was super nice but lots of other assignments
,,,,,,,,,,,"While the professor was extremely engaging and had very interesting lectures, I thought that the material in this class got a bit repetitive. If you've taken AP Psych or Intro to Psych, a lot of the material for this class will probably seem familiar. I thought the workload was definitely manageable, but the amount of readings can get a bit overwhelming. There is also one writing assignment due at the end of each week. I liked the writing assignments, as I could write them in a more casual language, and it was a nice break from the academic style that I'm used to writing in for college. I also loved my TA for this class, Ananya was so sweet and was always willing to help me understand the writing assignment prompts a bit more in her office hours. Overall, this class was interesting, but I'm also not sure how much I really learned in terms of new material."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class did a great job going into all the factors that affect a child's development, especially those that aren't seen as mainstream."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed the course content as I enjoyed weekly check in on the content learned in class, that was really nice."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was very enjoyable, it was interesting and relaxed but also useful. The material was communicated and available through many resources, and it was very easy to stay on track with the lectures. Professor Rogers was a fantastic lecturer, she was fun, understanding, and very engaging. The papers were very fun to write and they were not really a chore. I recommend this class for sure."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really love this class! Professor Rogers is so nice and I really liked how she structured the class. She taught with a lot of her research that was so interesting! She does a great job teaching the black and mixed–race development experience. The work load is very reasonable. Only writing assignments and no tests I highly recommend this class!
,,,,,,,,,,,Rogers is an informative instructor that keeps you engaged. only graded on weekly responses that aren't that hard and a final project which takes some time. easy class especially for a distro. definitely would recommend. TA's r super helpful and chill. discussions are also very chill.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was very interesting, but less focused on actual developmental psychology, more focus on the sociology of race and gender. I still enjoyed the class, and felt that its structure was conducive to the success of students. Rather than giving exams or quizzes, it is project–based, and students can capitalize on explaining aspects of the class that they understand best in projects."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There are no tests, but instead there are 3 big assignments and a final project. The topics of the assignments are interesting, but the wording of the prompts was always really confusing and hard to decipher."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think the professor did a good job with using inclusive language and texts, that made peopls of different backgrounds feel eager to learn more."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Class is not too hard, just keep up with readings"
,,,,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed this class. It had interesting material and was relatively stress–free. There are weekly one–page essays with three longer papers throughout the quarter. There is a decent amount of reading required for this class but most of the material is covered again in the lecture.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was the best class I have ever taken at Northwestern and I am a sophomore. The topic matter was very engaging, applicable to our lives, the readings and journals were so interesting and professor Rogers is the coolest person ever. She is so smart kind and engaging. Take this class with Rogers whether you are interested in developmental psychology!! MY TA Blaise was also the best TA I have ever had. This class is some easy papers that I actually loved writing because they were so interesting and applicable to my life. Not only is it very easy to do well in this class, I got so much out of it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There were 5 weekly writing assignments and 3 essays, not including the final. The class was interesting and graded fairly. I would recommend taking it."
,,,,,,,,,,,I think the content of this course was focused on the right things. It made you think while not prompting too much work.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I absolutely loved this course. It's such an interesting topic and Onnie teaches it in such an engaging way. I especially loved all the video examples we watched and discussed in class, it was a really good way to see and understand the topics we were learning while also getting to watch cute entertaining baby videos. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Psych, the workload isn't too heavy and the grading is very fair."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was very interesting and easy. Professor Rogers was passionate about what she lecturing and the articles she suggested were fun to read.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is an amazing class take it. Professor Rogers is so sweet and I really loved the way in which this class was taught. There are discussion questions each Friday (they are super easy), 3 applied assignments, and a final project. The TAs (especially Patrick Zacher) are really approachable and helpful. One of my favourite classes."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is so awesome. Take it with Professor Rodgers. I learned a lot and it was not stressful at all. 10/10
,,,,,,,,,,,I think this was a pretty easy psych class. You have discussion questions to do every week (which are basically just a page long discussion post) and 4 applied assignment (~4 pages long) throughout the quarter. I didn't end up doing a lot of the reading and I think I ended up fine. It was an interesting class though especially to help you think about yourself and how you grew up! I also appreciated how Professor Rogers brought a kind of sociological perspective to the class. I thought it was interesting to see how that intersected with psychology so much
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Rogers is the best and by far the best professor I had this quarter. Her lectures are engaging and the course materials are interesting and relevant. I never felt like I was doing busy work, everything I read was applicable and useful to our assignments. The weekly discussion questions can sometimes feel like a lot of work, but ultimately they did help me understand material better. In this class I appreciated the fact that we did not have traditional exams. Instead, we had midterm 2 page essays called Applied Assignments (AA) and a final project. I never dreaded doing the work for this class and finished AAs very easily. This is the best class I took this quarter, and if you get the opprtunity to take it with Professor Rogers you HAVE to take it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall I did enjoy this class, the topics were interesting and there was not too much work (although there was a lot of reading at times). Readings and lectures could be a bit long and boring sometimes if you're not super interested in the topics, but Professor Rogers is super cool and cares about her students."
,,,,,,,,,,,I felt as though this course touched on topics that we don't normally talk about on a daily basis. It challenged me to understand the complexities of identity through the lense of child development.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Hands down this is one of the greatest courses I’ve had at Northwestern so far, but it could also be that I found developmental psychology interesting before taking this course and I love it even more now. Prof. Rogers is a great lecturer and truly cares about making sure her students learn the material rather than pure memorization. You’re expected to come into lecture having read the chapter/reading for that day but it really just helps make sure you're familiar with the content, I would read the chapters and it took about 1 hour–ish. Also, Prof. Rogers does not have any exams, just short weekly discussion papers, 3 applied assignments/papers, and 1 final project. I found this very manageable along with other classes and the assignments were also interesting because it allowed you to apply concepts learned in class to real–life situations. Many of the discussion papers had a lot to do about personal life and your own development which I found really interesting (it almost felt therapeutic). In terms of grading, it honestly does come down to your TA, mine was really good about giving constructive feedback and being helpful in clarifying the applied assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Rogers is the sweetest, but this class was too focused on perpetuating specific racial and progressive ideologies (I say this as a liberal). Every lecture was eventually tied back to critical race theory, transgenderism, or other radical economic theories. There was no room to push back or disagree with the professor's words. I don't think professors should be allowed to push their personal philosophies on students without an opportunity for discussion. For instance, there was constant discussion of how ethnic minorities live at the whims of white people in society, which is fairly patronizing in my view. Easy class, though, you're guaranteed to get good grades if you say the right things."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a good class. It's a pretty easy A and the assignments were not overwhelming. There was typically either a discussion question or applied assignment due each week. Both were fairly easy. There is quite a bit of reading, but it's easy to get away with not doing them or just skimming. Plus the lectures summed up the textbook chapters. Professor Rogers is a good lecturer and is kind."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was so interesting because it not only covered textbook concepts, but had relevant research/applications embedded into it which made content a lot more intriguing. One important thing to note, however, is that this course is heavily writing and reading based."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is an interesting, easy A. Professor Rogers & TAs seem to truly care about the wellbeing of students & that you're learning. The weekly reading responses for this class are almost like journalling prompts that allow you to reflect on your own development. You can miss 2 discussion sections & skip one reading response, but if life happens my TA was super understanding and accommodating."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class goes over the revised bioecological model a lot, and generally the idea that culture is involved in every aspect of development. There's a section that goes over the psychology of the development of racial identity which was really interesting to me. The readings had a lot more non–white authors than other psych classes I've taken which I appreciated. Most lecture materials discussed race in a white/Black sense in my opinion, but in discussion section students drew on our own backgrounds."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is amazing. Onnie is my favorite professor and she genuinely cares about the subject and her students. The class is all essays no exams because she understands the stress of them and doesn't want to put her students through that. The final project is pretty time–consuming, but all of the writing is interesting so it's not too bad. Easy to do well if you try."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Covered a lot of interesting subjects and loved writing essays for midterms and final instead of taking exams, way less stressful."
,,,,,,,,,,,It is very important to understand why we behave the way we do. It allowed me to understand human behavior
,,,,,,,,,,,One of the most important aspects for me were the connections I could make to other psych classes that I was taking; I liked being able to learn about models that were applicable to other aspects of my learning in psych
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked the deep strong focus on childhood development, but I wished it also touched on how these childhood factors play a role in our lives today in adulthood."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course. The workload was manageable even though there were a lot of readings. I found every topic that we went over really interesting and I loved that we got to reflect on our own identity when doing the discussion questions. As a freshmen, I found this class as a great introduction to psychology classes at Northwestern and hope to take more classes like this in the future. Professor Rogers is an amazing Professor so if you are going to take Developmental Psych take it with her!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Easy A course with no exams. very easy and you dont really have to go to lectures
,,,,,,,,,,,"I wasn't super interested in developmental psych to begin with and this course didn't do much to change that. Professor Rogers is great and is obviously very passionate about this subject. However, I just didn't love the structure of the course and I feel like I didn't really learn anything new."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class! Prof. Rogers is a clear lecturer; I found her presentations engaging and easy to follow. The assignments are not too difficult as long as you pay attention in lectures and generally keep up with the readings. Discussion sections on Fridays are very chill.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a fun, interesting, and laidback class. Professor Rogers is excellent and so friendly. The lectures were fun and engaging and the work load was light."
,,,,,,,,,,,Fairly easy course and the content was interesting to learn about. Lectures were structured in a way that made it hard to follow completely how each each concept connects to each other. Discussion sections were very helpful to solidify the topics of the week. Do the readings and you will be good for all the written assignments.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very manageable class with Dr. Rogers! There were 6 discussion prompts you had to write, 1/week, which were 2 pages double–spaced. They were very manageable and often asked you to reflect on your own experiences. There were 3 applied assignments (essays), which were 4 pages double–spaced. Prof. Rogers clearly outlines a bunch of questions that you should answer, so meeting the page count was never difficult. The final was an analysis of 8 pages double spaced, and then a 4 page reflection. It was a lot, but manageable. Not a difficult class to balance with harder, more time–intensive classes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was well taught and engaging, but it was a bit too focused on ideological subjects for it to feel substantive and scientific. Lots of cultural and racial politics, which are important, but a bit flimsy from an academic standpoint."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Rogers is super kind, approachable, helpful, and knowledgeable — she's a great professor. But I think her style of not having any exams or taking attendance, while less stressful for students, gave me zero incentive to keep up with the readings or study any of the class material. I liked how she incorporates mini–discussion times during lecture, but I felt that the lack of tests or guidance about what material to study/keep up with meant that I simply showed up to lecture, took notes, and did the parts of the readings that allowed me to answer the applied assignments and discussion questions. The grading for all the assignments was super easy, so I didn't feel very challenged either. I'm grateful she began uploading the lecture slides because looking back at them was super helpful for the final project. I thought the final project was really fun and a great way to tie in the class content; however, it felt like it was the only assignment that really pushed me to really engage with the class content in a memorable way. I think the applied assignments are useful, but I think some sort of method that would actually make sure we learned or memorized the class content would've let me walk away from the class being able to effectively explain to another person what happens at each stage of development from memory. I know that learning and studying was up to me, but I think that the class should be structured with some grading/learning accountability in its design as well. The fact that the lecture hall was only about 1/3 full by the end of the quarter showed that students found out they could get away with just showing up to discussion section for the attendance points without doing the readings or taking notes at lecture. I also think the class content focused disproportionately on sociocultural and racial development theories. While those topics are super important, I felt like there were other theories (like more biological or evolutionary–oriented) and identities (religious, socioeconomic status, nationality/immigrant status, ethnicity (not just race), physical traits, geographic location, etc.) that would've been important to learn about. I do think that it was important for the class to talk about systemic inequalities that affect development, but I felt like those topics fell more in the bucket of sociology rather than developmental psychology when we covered them repeatedly in multiple lectures. I really enjoyed the lectures on language, schools, and Piaget's theories (especially in comparison to sociocultural theories like Vygotsky). Discussion section was very laid back, but it didn't actually require you to do the readings and felt more like an identity–sharing session rather than a developmental psychology discussion. It was fun to hear the personal perspectives of my classmates, but I didn't feel like I was actually learning any psychology research or content — we were just reiterating sociological concepts like hierarchy, power, intersectionality, and privilege. I think these topics are important to learn about, but not to such an extensive degree in a class labelled ""Developmental Psychology."""
wnbg,psych,244,winter,Sara Broaders,5.15,4.79,5.36,4.88,5.10,7.08,"Prof. Broaders has really high expectations for this class. The lectures are extremely interesting (you will not be bored!) but the amount of content can feel pretty overwhelming. Some of it will be review if you have already learned about attachment, temperament, or operant/classical conditioning. You don't need to read every single word in the textbook readings, but make sure that you read the chapter summaries and know all the key terms. The exams expect you to know A LOT, and you will need to write literal essays to get full credit on the short answer questions. Give yourself a lot of time to study and you will be okay – use the practice quizzes and practice short answer questions on Canvas. It's super helpful to find a friend in the class and talk through these questions together. You will also need to complete two homework assignments at some point during the quarter, just don't wait until the last minute!! Ultimately you will come away from this class with an incredible understanding of developmental psychology and get to watch a lot of cute baby videos!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was one of my favorite psych classes because I was very interested in the material. Professor Broaders is a fantastic lecturer. I did find the exams to be harder than I anticipated and had to study a lot. But, if you put in the work, this class is very fascinating."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned so much, and Professor Broaders was such a fun lecturer! It is not an easy A by any means, but at least it's possible (especially with the extra credit you get for just attending to class)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I have a few comments about the exams. I felt the amount of detail required to satisfactorily answer the open ended questions was a bit too much. Especially since we had written papers during the quarter where we wrote about the same topics in extensive prose. Also, the amount of time allotted to the exam makes it a little unfair to expect a lot of detail in the open–ended questions in addition to completing a multiple–choice portion. I would recommend reducing the open–ended questions since at least one of them is testing a topic that is addressed in the homework papers hence I would say repetitive. Nonetheless, an interesting class with many opportunities to earn extra credit."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed how systematic the course was, it made it much easier to study for midterms and finals"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course and content was overall very interesting. This class is very challenging and a lot of time is needed. Lectures tend to be engaging and exams are skewed towards lecture notes. Readings from the textbook tend to be very dense and sometimes contradict the lecture slides. Exams are also challenging and need to be able to understand and apply the concepts, not just memorize them. It's nice that the lowest exam gets dropped, so it's still manageable to get a good grade in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Broaders was a pretty good lecturer but overall, I just didn't really end up enjoying the course material all that much."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Broaders is a bit no–nonsense but the class is fun and interesting. You'll find most of the lectures fun, albeit a bit fast paced. Two midterms that are required, optional final to replace lowest of the midterms scores. There are six homework assignments, but you only have to do two of them. Not a lot of work outside class but the class is almost entirely dependent on exams and they're no breeze. Achievable to get an A but not easy"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this class and thought the material was relevant and interesting. A lot of it is material I learned in AP Psych, but that just makes it easier to do well in the class since it's a refresher. There's a lot of reading involved (one textbook chapter per week), but it's manageable. 2 papers were straightforward if you planned ahead and chose prompts that are easier to answer (you choose to do 2/6 possible essays). Past CTECs said the papers were difficult and hard to get an A, but I found it easy to get an A on both so it probably depends on the TAs. Midterms are multiple choice and free response. Multiple choice is similar to the practice quizzes so practice them a lot (do all the practice quizzes until you get 100 to study). Free response is much harder, but you can get partial credit. Broaders' lecturing style is engaging and includes videos, so it's not too hard to sit through. Come to class on time and every class for the extra credit."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course definitely covered child development from a variety of perspectives, which I found important. There were themes that were tied into each unit very nicely to display the continuities and discontinuities of child development."
,,,,,,,,,,,Good presentations and well explained lectures
,,,,,,,,,,,"For this class, you have to make sure that you're keeping up with the material on your own time. The course material is designed so you hold YOURSELF accountable to make sure that you read the textbook, take the chapter quizzes, and get the homework done. Professor Broaders is good at outlining the content and explaining it but you also can't rely too much on ONLY the lectures. That being said, there are many opportunities for you to improve your grade in case you might flunk on a midterm or an assignment."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course does well to make the content engaging. The workload is very manageable and the exams are dependent on attending lectures. Overall, it was a great course to take."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Broaders is a good lecturer and she seems to know a lot about the subject. The lectures were mostly well–organized, however they were always one lecture behind the reading. So the reading due Tuesday wouldn't be covered until Thursday. That confused me and made my notes harder to follow. For the most part, this class was sufficient and somewhat engaging. If you have any interest in kids or psychology, it's a good class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class, the teacher was very knowledgeable and kept the class engaged. Interesting subject with reasonable grading and amount of assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The readings for this class take so long to get through, especially since there's material that you'll need to know from the readings that aren't gone over in class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked this class. Prof Broaders is a good lecturer, and the assignments were very reasonble. We were able to drop our worst grade on the exams (or just only take 2 out of the 3) which was nice."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Broaders is notoriously hard but if you show up to lecture––which is always super fun and engaging––you can do well in the course. The textbook readings are important but super long, so I suggest you read them after each corresponding lecture to get a sense of what is most important to know. The class activities and the videos shown were always a great time, and I feel like I understand child development so much more in depth for taking this class! Definitely recommend"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was really interesting! I learned a lot. Tests are challenging but not impossible, just study everything (lecture focused). Office hours are really helpful as well!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great class. Really interesting material, tough midterms though."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really informative if you're genuinely interested in child development – otherwise, would look to other distros or major requirements. The workload is pretty hefty, and Broaders can grade pretty strict – though she's a super engaging lecturer. Two midterms and a final (weighted evenly, lowest score is dropped)."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was super interesting and Professor Broaders gives great lectures.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Content heavy, difficult grades for homework, complicated test questions."
,,,,,,,,,,,The exams of this course were challenging and you must attend lecture to understand content. There are a few papers involved and weekly online quizzes. Them professor was very engaging. Paper notes are highly encouraged for this course.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Dr. Broaders is a good lecturer and really tries to engage students during the class in discussions, and I felt like I learned some important things about developmental psychology."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, this class is not an easy A. If you have a busy schedule, don't take it. It's super interesting and Broaders is great, but it can be frustrating when you study for days and end up getting a B on the midterms because you missed a detail or two on the free response questions. This class is all memorization and it's very very dense. You have to spend hours reading the textbook and memorizing if you aren't good with memorization. The extra credit points help, but you absolutely have to go to every single class. She doesn't record or post anything she lectures on. Her slides are really unhelpful, so you have to go to class and listen intently. She drops your lowest exam grade, but the second midterm and final are so close together, you barely have time to study. This is a really interesting class, but I just wish grading on the homeworks and frq's were a little bit more lenient because it took the enjoyment out of the class to try and figure out what Broaders and the TA wanted exactly out of me even though I knew the information. You have to know everything in and out 200%. Get ready to study hard if you take this class, because Broader is great, but she will push you to be the best!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course was great! Content was interesting and the prof did a good job of explaining things in digestible and stimulating ways! Also, the cute kid videos that were regularly present in the lectures legitimately made my day a lot of the time. EC is relatively generous if you actually show up to class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"As an engineer taking this course I'd say yeah it helped me learn. I think the most I got out of it was a prompt for considering my own development, as well as things to consider for when I become a parent. There was a lot of content I had seen in AP Psych in high school, just went more in depth. The textbook is essential as well as the lectures, so you can't just choose one or the other. I learned after the first midterm that doing some reading is important otherwise you'll end up with like a 75%. Teacher wasn't bad. Generally a pretty light course as long as you read and show up."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course seems scary from afar but there are so many extra credit opportunities that it shouldn't scare you. Go to class. That gets you extra credit all by itself. Go to every class, get there on time, and you'll probably pass. The instructor did have a bit of a weird technology policy which threw me off at first, but stick with it there is literally so much extra credit you will be fine. There IS some excessive reading but honestly, I barely did it and the exams didn't feel too reading–centric. There are 6 essays and you choose 2 to submit (3 if you want to make a better grade) and the TAs graded them very nicely. The exams are a mix of multiple choice and FRQ, the FRQ's are ok, make sure you know theories and the psychologists and stuff. Really great class"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was told Broaders is the hardest Psych teacher here. Her tests are long and test on videos you will only be able to see once and only if you go to class. Luckily she gives lots of extra credit and the conceptual explanation questions are not challenging if you actually do some work to understand the material. Not a bad class over all, but it does require a good amount of work."
,,,,,,,,,,,Very interesting course but also a lot of work. I put in a lot of effort to study for this and it's still my lowest grade. Broaders is a great lecturer and you will most certainly learn a lot from this class but be prepared to put in that work because if you don't put in the time outside to keep up you will be left behind. There's a lot of information to remember but overall rewarding.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I have mixed feelings about this class. On one hand, I think the exams were fair and everything was graded appropriately. Professor Broaders is pretty engaging in lectures and sometimes lectures were fun (I appreciate the videos). The lowest exam score is dropped, which means if you did well on the midterms, you do not have to take the final. She also offers extra credit occasionally for showing up to class and participating, which is very kind of her. However, this is not an easy class. I think the content itself is easy enough to understand with some effort, but there was such an unnecessary amount of work. Exams are the bulk of your grade and they took information from both the lectures and the textbook. You will fail the exams if you try to avoid reading the textbook and sometimes topics will not be covered in lecture, but you'd still be expected to know it because it was in the book. There was also a lot of content to cover and everything moved at an extremely fast pace, so attendance is basically mandatory (she does not record lectures). Getting a good grade in the class is doable, but it requires quite the amount of effort."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class felt like a lot of what we learned in AP psych just more in depth. If you do all of the readings, it's gonna be a lot of work. But I know some people didn't do any of them and probably got by just fine. If you study and stay on top of the work, it isn't bad. The two homework assignments arent bad at all. Prof Broaders is so knowledgable, charismatic, and really loves to teach. She lets you drop your lowest exam grade so you might not even have to take the final which is nice. The lecture itself is super interesting and you'll do great if you're willing to put in the work!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was very interesting and Broaders is a great professor who really gets students engaged in the coursework. We do have the read the book though which takes a lot of time. It's just a lot of information that you need to know to do well.
,,,,,,,,,,,"There is a huge focus on exams and going to lecture. Without those, this class will be unnecessarily difficult."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed the content of the course. However, it practically took over my schedule. You have to put in a lot of effort to do well in the exams and papers. Textbook readings and attending lectures are a must and the free responses are graded tediously so you have to have lengthy detailed responses. Overall, if you are interested in the subject and are willing to put in the time and energy, I'd definitely recommend it. You have to complete 2/6 papers and there are 3 total exams (one of which can be dropped). Additionally, there are practice quizzes for each module which are extremely annoying and inconsistent with lecture material but they do show up on exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVE THIS CLASS. If you're even the slightest bit interested in Psych, I would take this class with Professor Broaders, she's amazing."
,,,,,,,,,,,The grading for any written portion of this class is extremely silly –– particularly if you are unfortunate enough to not have a TA grader but rather the professor instead. There is no communication about writing expectations and arbitrary deductions are consistently made. This was the most disappointing aspect of the course despite the remainder being largely well put together.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I have mixed feelings about the class. I really like Broaders as a teacher and thought the energy and preparedness for class each day was great. The issue I have is each class was sit down, listen to lecture slide after lecture slide for 1.5 hours, and then leave. You were then expected to commit all the information to memory for the exam. Felt like a lot of facts and theories that were loosely connected but I didn't find it the best way to learn. I struggle with memorization and the midterm prep took forever which was a downside."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Her slides and lectures are a bit painstakingly long and there's almost an impossible amount of material being fed to you. However, she seems like a great person in general and I enjoyed the subjects we talked about."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Broaders is very engaging, using a lot of multimedia and personal examples/home videos to supplement the content. Two very straightforward 3–page essays as HW assignments. 2 midterms (non–cumulative) and you can choose to drop one and take a cumulative MCQ–only final. I felt that there was a lot more content for midterm 1 but midterm 2 was extremely straightforward. MCQs on tests are largely straightforward if you've studied the content, but the long answer questions were relatively challenging. Could have done with more time on the midterms and felt that I was always rushing to finish. Lots of extra–credit opportunities which made a notable difference in the final score. Very effective and engaging teaching overall. Highly recommend the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Overall a very positive experience.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is a good distro, but still a decent amount of work. Being able to drop one of the midterms/the final was a nice aspect of the course, and Dr. Broaders is enthusiastic about helping her students succeed. The TA's, however, were hard to reconcile with, and were inconsistent in grading."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It was not an easy A but it is very manageable. The professor is extremely helpful, understanding and flexible. Exams are very similar to the practices quizzes. Overall, you are given the material to succeed in this class although it is challenging."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed this class! Professor Broaders is such a fun and interactive teacher and I love that only 2 of the 3 exams are kept and that we got loads of extra credit
,,,,,,,,,,,"Thought this class was really great, recommend taking it! Lectures are always really interesting, Prof always shows videos and is funny. Grades are based on three exams (1 dropped, 35% each), two homework assignments (10% each), and some short quizzes (10%). You definitely have to show up to lectures and do the readings to do well on the exams, but they aren't hard at all. As long as you read through the chapters once and brush up on the lecture material a bit before the exams, you'll do fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this class. Developmental psych is not my favorite topic, but Professor Broaders made the class very interesting and engaging with activities and videos throughout the lecture. She was a very interesting lecturer as well and there were a lot of readings, but I liked that the whole grade was not just reliant on the tests. There are a couple of homework assignments and quizzes to add to it as well. Additionally, the final being optional and one test being dropped was helpful."
,,,,,,,,,,,i liked broaders. there were a lot of mixed reactions but I liked her.i  read the textbook summaries and not the actual chapters which were helpful. pace yourself when studying for the exam. the prac quizzes appear on the tests so use that as a tool. i studied a lot but still got low B's on the tests. the frqs were so hard and graded so hard. the ta's low–key were not helpful and hard to approach. broaders is funny and had engaging lectures. take notes on the slides and don't try writing everything– its too much to write down AND listen to what shes saying. manageable A– class.
wnbg,psych,244,spring,Sara Broaders,5.17,4.96,5.39,5.06,5.15,6.49,"This class teaches a lot of great content and is very interesting. I would recommend taking it. It is a lot of content and moves very fast. Sometimes, the lectures are a bit difficult to follow.(Lectures went very fast and were not thoroughly explained) However, once you get a hang of the class, it becomes much easier. Important to keep up with the readings."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Broaders is such a good lecturer & instructor, I would definitely recommend taking this class with her. I will say that the content of the class isn't too hard, but it is pretty fast paced – I was often really tired at the end of class. We also spent more than half of a lecture talking about Freud, which I'm still kind of confused about. Other than that, great class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,The lectures for this class are pretty interesting but it's a lot of work. There's practice quizzes for each unit and 3 homework assignments throughout the course in addition to two midterms and a final.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was so dull. The lectures were not engaging at all; I was always counting down the seconds until they were over, even when I found the content interesting. The TAs were instructed to grade way too harshly; they took off points for little nitpicky things that normal professors wouldn't have cared about. The homework assignments were vague and it was often difficult to figure out where I was supposed to be finding the information to write them. I will say that it was nice that she dropped the lowest exam grade (3 total, 2 counted) and there were a good amount of extra credit opportunities in class. Additionally, all the information you needed from the lecture was on the slides, so note–taking wasn't stressful. Broaders was very impersonal and uncaring, especially for the head of the psych department. Overall, probably wouldn't take this class again."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good course! I learned more in this class than any other psych class I've taken. The lectures move very fast and we are assigned a lot of textbook readings—you must read them to do well on the exams. We were offered a lot of extra credit and our lowest exam score is dropped! However, I would say that the homework assignments were graded unnecessarily harsh and placed more emphasis on format, writing style, and citations than your actual understanding of the content. All in all, it's a tough but rewarding course!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked how we were expected to complete 3/6 homework assignments, so there was some flexibility (with practice quizzes as well), but there was too much content to learn. It was very overwhelming to learn about all the theories while also having to write very demanding papers and taking quizzes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I do not feel that this class was structured in the most effective manner for student learning. I understand that it is difficult in larger classes, but overall, the class was overwhelming and I did not learn as much as I could have if it had not been that way. It was very hard to stay on top of things. A lot was expected of us in the class, such as many readings and video watchings to do outside of class, 3 homework assignments that were 3–4 page papers, knowing the details of multiple theories for many aspects of development (even down to knowing the ages at which each stage occurred, which was a lot to keep straight). This class is not a good one to take if you are already taking other high–effort classes, and if you get behind, it's more worthwhile to just drop the class rather than try to catch up (unless you have many hours per day you can devote to doing so). I did appreciate that you only have to take 2 out of the 3 exams, and if you take all 3, then your lowest score is dropped. Additionally, there were many extra credit opportunities offered in class. On that note, this is also a class where it is imperative to be in class and not skip unless absolutely necessary."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is definitely doable. 6 homework assignments, you choose 3 of them to do and 3 exams but she will drop the lowest grade so only two exams count. Definitely a very exam heavy class in terms of the weighting of the class but it is an interesting topic to learn about."
,,,,,,,,,,,It was pretty good. I would have appreciated less emphasize on dates and more on themes and ideas.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures were really detailed and informative. I also liked the supplemental materials to the textbook and lectures (eg. videos, readings). My only problem with the course is that studying for the tests was pretty stressful: anything and everything is on the tests, which makes it hard to study effectively when there’s so much information."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is great! Definitely not an easy A because you have to put a lot of work into it. I would recommend reading the textbook because it helps reinforce ideas. Overall I really liked this course and Prof. Broaders is an an amazing professor and lecturer. I also really like that you can drop a whole midterm.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The textbook reading can be a bit of a drag, but the essay topics were interesting and fairly graded! The content is super interesting– especially for psych fans. Definitely go to lectures too!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This class will make you work! There are 3 exams (lowest is dropped). 3 homework assignments and practice quizzes. She goes over a lot in each lecture so be prepared for that.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Broaders is such a good and clear lecturer. There is a lot of content to cover with the textbook and lecture slides, but Professor Broaders provides mini quizzes to serve as study guides for course content. There are 2 midterm exams with one optional final to replace a lower grade, and you will need to write 3 essays out of 6 given options throughout the quarter. Although this class requires a little more work, you learn so much about how development shapes your adult world. Would highly recommend taking this class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Honestly, the course felt pretty laid back which was great as I just took it for fun. It was very useful to learn concepts related to child development, even if some of the focus seemed to be on memorization of psychologist's names, regardless of the fact that that isn't really important to understanding the fundamental concepts."
,,,,,,,,,,,Both textbook material and lecture material are covered and they sometimes do not overlap.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was very challenging yet also very rewarding. The lectures were super entertaining, and I never found myself zoning out during class times. I will say that I had to study 30+ hours for each exam due to the extremely dense content, but if you put in the work you will do well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There are two midterms and a final, these count for most of the grade on top of three essays that are worth a quarter of the grade all together. There are practice quizzes available every week and these are tremendously helpful for getting a good grade on the exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Broaders is a really great lecturer, and you certainly learn a lot of cool things. Being able to pick 3 of the 6 HW assignments was really amazing because it allowed me to do them when I had less going on in my other classes. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,,,,The course is designed to help you succeed – there are plenty of extra credit opportunities in class (attend class!) and you can drop an exam with the final and drop an essay with another.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed the lectures very much and learned so much about myself. However, preparing for exams was a very tedious and stressful process. I would have enjoyed this course so much more without the large emphasis on midterms. Honestly, all the work outside of lecture were the things that made this course a little less enjoyable. Although the readings were interesting, they were very long, taking me about 2 hours to read each chapter. The module quizzes were helpful for the exam but there is one for every chapter that you read. The three papers that you have to write were very manageable. I just wrote the first three and didn't have to worry about it for the rest of the quarter. Overall, interesting class but you have to put in a lot of work."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Go to class, there's a lot of extra credit and extra opportunities to do well! The lectures were interesting, but maybe not necessary to do well. I suggest doing the readings and the practice test/"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Broaders is great. Go to class! She gives extra credit points that go towards exam scores just for being there! The lectures are super fun and engaging. She plays tons of fun videos. The tests are very reasonable and most people do pretty well. As well, there are three tests, but you only need to take two of them. If you score badly on one of the midterms, the final can replace that grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would recommend doing all the required readings, as she usually will throw in a multiple choice problem about them. Besides the fact that she thinks babies can do physics, this class is very applicable in MCAT studying. Would highly recommend. I am an engineer and this was my fun GPA boost class of the quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Whether or not you are interested in child development, this class has something valuable for everyone who takes it. Learning how humans are shaped mentally from their earliest days is really fascinating, and though Prof. Broaders can be a bit intense sometimes she is an incredible lecturer. She engages the class through questions, activities, and really interesting videos along with lecture material, and I always felt like I was leaving the class with a valuable piece of knowledge."
,,,,,,,,,,,The course works with very interesting concepts that examine what children are capable of at different ages and how perspectives on that differ. The course is based on exams (multiple choice and free response) and short papers (I would recommend going to office hours to discuss your arguments with the TAs).
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is a great introduction to developmental psych – just go into it expecting to work hard. Homework assignments are manageable, and you cover a lot of information in lectures but it's presented in a clear and accessible way. Prof. Broaders is a good lecturer, and course content is organized and easy to find on Canvas. I would definitely recommend this class if you're interested in the topic."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is definitely what I would call ""bulky."" Textbook chapters that you have to read, lectures you have to attend, a few practice quizzes (for completion), and then at least three short essays (but if you complete four, the lowest grade is dropped). The midterms are also fairly difficult and require a decent amount of studying. If you work hard, you'll get a B+ or A–, but getting an A I would say is hard. There are two midterms and an optional final, the lowest grade of the three gets dropped. Sometimes the written questions on the final are graded harshly which was a bummer. Overall, if you're interested in the subject, you'll learn a lot, but maybe not worth the work if this is for a distro."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Both class and the textbook covered topics very comprehensively, and Broaders lectures in a way that is very engaging. If you do both you will most definitely learn a lot and succeed. I don't think this class was particularly easy, but it was definitely manageable, and you learn a lot of quite useful things for understanding yourself at a minimum, and if your future career requires you to interact with kids in anyway this class should probably be necessary for you."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was fascinating, I highly recommend to anyone who thinks they would be interested in the subject. The course material is super interesting and engaging. However, the tests are very challenging so it won't be an easy grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class. Initially, this was not the psych class I wanted to take this quarter but I'm glad I did. I would say there were definitely more readings than in intro psych and fewer extra credit opportunities but it was still manageable. Each week we had readings to complete and a practice quiz on Canvas after each module. Sometimes we also had to watch documentaries and complete additional readings outside of the textbook. This made studying for the midterms a bit more stressful because everything was fair game on the exam. But I think the exams had an emphasis on the lecture slides. So there were two midterms and an optional final (that could be used to drop the lowest exam). We also had to complete 3 out of 6 papers (that were about 3–4 pages long). You could also complete a 4th paper to drop your lowest exam grade if you wanted to."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Broaders was also great! She was clearly passionate about the material and I loved when she played her home videos in class to help explain a topic.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great course for the psychology major, and Professor Broaders is amazing! I really appreciated having an optional final at the end of the year, and the midterms are challenging but fair!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a solid psych course, especially if you need it as a distro. As long as you keep up with the readings and attend lectures, you will be fine. There are a lot of extra credit opportunities if you just attend lecture, too."
wnbg,psych,245,fall,Steven Franconeri),5.10,4.63,4.54,4.17,5.39,4.92,Overall the course was fine. I found instructions on homework and expectations in order to get a good grade were very vague with no rubrics or specific advice or instructions.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was awesome! It's definitely not like any other psych class at NU, but it's extremely useful for literally any field you will go into. You learn extremely useful skills like graphic design and how to give an effective presentation & elevator pitch. Prof. Franconeri is a great and lively lecturer who gets the point across in really cool psychological ways. There are reading quizzes almost every class so make sure you do the readings, but they are easy and you should be able to do them in like an hour before class starts. Do note that the class is only once a week so it's 3 hours long and it's at NIGHT, so it definitely clashed with some of my social plans..."
,,,,,,,,,,,"this course was cool and interesting. I liked the assignments (ex: re–visualizing data from published psych studies) bc they were different that my other psych classes. however, this course was a bit disorganized at times, and due dates kept changing. there are also pop quizzes, but they weren't too bad. prof franconeri is very engaging and nice!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Assignments vary from week to week, but most are centered around group work. We did a redesign of a flyer, some assignments with excel/tableau, and made presentations/videos about research articles. The course covers design principles and then shows you how you can apply these principles in presentations, advertisements, scientific presentations etc. The material is really interesting but the application of it with hw assignments is also really helpful. Your grade is based on small reading quizzes, projects, and class participation. Overall, the workload is very manageable and the material is very relevant. I would definitely recommend this class, it will improve your ability to present information to others more clearly (but also does not require a lot of live public speaking – your presentations are usually recorded and critiqued by other peers/TAs)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm very conflicted about how to review this course. On one hand, the course content was fascinating and extremely useful, and Professor Franconeri made lectures so engaging and great to go to that the three hour lecture felt faster than some of my lectures half of that length. On the other hand, there were points in the quarter where I was extremely frustrated with the class, from having the syllabus changed multiple times and doing assignments that never actually had to be completed to simultaneously working on three different group projects with three different groups. Many of these issues were due to guest speakers changing their schedules and whatnot, but I still feel as though a class on effectively presenting ideas would provide less confusing directions for assignments. If these issues are changed, I would highly recommend taking this course; otherwise, be prepared for some logistical difficulties."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall helpful class to take at some point. Some of the material felt like common sense, but sometimes it's those details that people often forget or underestimate when presenting. There were quite a few mini group projects which was nice because you got to meet different people (but sometimes a little confusing since you had different groups for each assignment). The lectures went by pretty quickly as Prof Franconeri is a good lecturer and is really engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good course, can imagine using everything in real life"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was great! Super useful information on how to create good presentations and data visualizations, totally applicable to any major. Super engaging professor, this class was totally worth taking. It actually helped me discover my interest in data communication and influenced my change in major! Great experience!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Surprisingly useful class!! Headed in with skepticism but overall the Professor was great, the class was chill, and homework’s were easy, and the content was very helpful."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I have never taken a more disorganized class in my life. Deadlines were changing constantly, the canvas page was never clear or updated. We didn't have a single grade until week 7 (well after the drop deadline) and didn't have an idea of our final grade until Thanksgiving break. All the group projects with new groups was so pointless because the hardest part about the assignments was also coordinating your schedules with new people every week – which quite frankly, feels like an unreasonable expectation for students."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This content is so interesting and applicable. Though, I really didn't love how we didn't submit any assignments (virtually) on our own. Every assignment was a group assignment, each time with different people, and there was no way to contact them other than Canvas or the student directory (which proved to be harder than you think). The syllabus was changed every week to add new assignments, and the due dates seemed rather strange (like a 3pm on a Monday or a 5pm on a Tuesday when our class was on Thursday). I really enjoyed the lectures (and would ultimately recommend taking this class), but the grading system seemed arbitrary (he would say it is tough to get 100% and then take off decimal points from an assignment without explaining why or providing a rubric)."
,,,,,,,,,,,I was interested in the powerpoint techniques
,,,,,,,,,,,"for a class that teaches organization, THIS WAS THE MOST UNORGANIZED CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN. do not take this class with Franconeri. He is nice I guess but a horrible prof. So disorganized. Says we would learn excel/tableau and then we are expected to do it alone.... that is not teaching. pop quizzes on super boring readings !!!!! this was a 3 hr class and it was genuinely so hard to make it through the three hours. do not take this class if you actually want to learn."
,,,,,,,,,,,"franceroni is a really good prof and the topics in class are really interesting but so much of the class feels arbitrary. there are general guidelines for what you should do for each assignment, but what constitutes a ""10"" grade from a ""9"" grade feels like it's completely based on how the grader feels atm. this is even true with simple ""completion"" assignments when you finish something, but lose points. the most frustrating thing about this isn't even that you're losing points, but it's that most feedback aren't returned until the end of the quarter, with most assignments not even having feedback but just a number grade attached. how are we expected to improve if we don't know what we're doing wrong? overall, the class feels like we are just consuming information via textbook and lectures and regurgitating it on the pop quizzes and trying to apply it to our assignments (whether we are doing it proficiently or not). but at the end of the day, we aren't truly learning."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is a must–take for all NU students. Prof. Franconeri is great, and the content is very, very applicable to everything one does career–wise."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great course! Prof. Franconeri is incredibly dedicated and a great lecturer. You learn a lot of practical skills, from learning to use Tableau to just generally understanding how to make ideas stick in people's heads. The class is sometimes disorganized due to the fact that Prof. Franconeri has to schedule around new guest lecturers every year, but for me this wasn't a huge problem. Definitely take the time to apply course concepts to assignments, the grading can be a bit tough but fair."
,,,,,,,,,,,I enjoyed this course overall even though it was unorganized at times with assignment due dates being changed a lot and grading not coming out until close to the end of the quarter.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Franconeri is a great lecturer and keeps the class engaging. He encourages participation every class. The only thing is that everything is group work and you get assigned new, random groups for every assignment. Sometimes the class can be a bit disorganized, but I still think it's worth taking no matter your major."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was quite disappointing. While the topic is very relevant and interesting, it was not taught in a way helped me learn. Professor Franconeri is very nice, but the class is insanely disorganized. We barely knew our grades all quarter and the assignments' due dates were constantly in flux. The constant group work was really annoying and the assignments themselves felt like busy work. That said, it is not at all hard to do well in this course, so it's an easy major/minor requirement."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The professor was great at keeping you attentive during his class and it was obvious that he is very knowledgeable and passionate about what he does and teaches. I wish the course was much more organized and assignments didn't get switched around so often. I also wish that we had one consistent group throughout the whole quarter instead of having a different, random group for each assignment."
,,,,,,,,,,,"take this class if u can!! the professor really wants to teach you valuable skills, and the content is interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"SUPER USEFUL CLASS. Teaches you real–world skills. Presentations are used everywhere, but this class gives you a totally new perspective on how to make a GOOD presentation. You also learn data analysis and visualizations skills – something so fundamental that I wonder why I haven't learned this before. Everybody should learn these skills. Take this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I had extremely mixed feelings about this class. Professor Franconeri is a passionate engaging lecture and is also thinks incredibly highly of himself. The material is simple, there isn’t actually too much covered in class. The coolest part were the guest speakers who talked about their work and discussed applications. I just wish Prof. Franconeri didn’t interrupt them constantly. The rest of the class was an absolute mess. It met once a week for 3 hours from 5–8 which is far too long and late for anyone to stay focused. The majority of assignments were group assignments but there was no way to ensure that group members contacted each other. The other assignments were to critique other class members work and the way in which those critiques were assigned was incredibly complicated for no reason. (Usually involved looking up some code number matching it to a spreadsheet, looking up other code numbers, downloading pdf files, submitting different google forms upwards of 10 times with different codes and identifiers). Assignments and due dates were constantly being changed and adjustments were poorly communicated. Grading was completely arbitrary. Everything was subjective while pretending to be objective. Professor said there would be pop quizzes— had a quiz every single week. This class had so much potential to be interesting and useful but just ended up being a waste of time. I wish there was more practice building actual data visualizations and refining our skills. Ended up being very disappointed."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great course, very useful. You learn about how to make effective presentations and data visualizations. Pretty easy as well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Okay so i took this course as a 3 hr class on Thursday nights which was rough. Franconeri though is AN AMAZING LECTURER. i get bored in 50 minute lectures, and I found myself engaged for at least the first half of the class. I disliked that he changed the schedule for assignments a lot and much of the syllabus was wrong and changed like 3 days before an assignment was due. But, aside from that, the information learned is so valuable. You learn how to effectively present and tell stories which is something I think is missing from undergraduate discourse so this class was really great for that."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Was initially very excited about this class, but the once a week 3 hr thursday night class format was kinda brutal. Prof. Franconeri is a great lecturer and clearly teaches in a way that incorporates what he's learned from his research. I wish we had less group projects however, and the workload felt like a lot at times given we only met once a week."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Does what it says in course description. The majority of coursework are very helpful in terms of learning, especially for presentation and graphic design. However, this course is heavily group work based. In other word, your luck may determine your final grade. Hard A, easy A–."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor is a great lecturer, and I always found the 3–hr lecture engaging. However, since we have a few guest lectures scattered throughout the quarter, the syllabus/course schedule can be very disorganized. The grading standards for participation are unclear as well. Take this class if you excel or like to design posters and make elevator pitches and presentations. While your grade is unknown for most of the quarter, it's not very hard to do well in this class, and there's a curve and extra credits"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The overall premise of the class is super interesting, but halfway through the quarter it kind of felt like we learned most of what we needed to know. The schedule for the class was super unorganized and I was constantly in limbo about what was due and when."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, I thought this class was useful in understanding data visualization, and I do feel like I learned how to present data in an effective manner. However, I would have appreciated more organization in the class, as deadlines constantly changed and there was not effective communication between the professor/TAs and students. I think the professors and TAs are aware of this feedback, and hopefully it will be implemented for the next time the class is taught."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I did get a better understanding of how to best design slides, but I wish we had more time to learn how to use Tableau"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class! Literally everyone can get something out of this class and it's really interesting, and the professor is a great communicator and funny. I really enjoyed taking this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great course, I think that only professor Franconeri could make this engaging for a 3 hour class. Was mostly group projects, which I didn't love but the projects were super interesting. Loved the material, and especially found the Tableau+Excel unit extremely helpful. Short quizzes and participation were also a decent part of my grade."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a really interesting class! We learned a lot of practical skills for communicating data (really good for resume!) and how to our audience understand and remember our presentations. Prof Franconeri also invited a lot of cool guest speakers from different fields to talk about their work and how they communicate complex data/ideas. The class meets once a week and does not have a heavy workload. There are a lot of group projects, and you are with a different group every time, which could be hard to coordinate. But overall, this is a really cool but also useful course that I think everyone should take no matter their field of study."
,,,,,,,,,,,I suggest this course to anyone because you will definitely gain the hard skills you need to succeed in any field you go into after you graduate.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The first few classes were quite educational, while the rest lacked any new/valuable material. Franconeri is a great lecturer, keeps the 3 hour class as interesting as possible, but the class is extremely disorganized. So many things that he said we would do in the beginning never actually happened, and our final grades were pretty harsh and random given that the individual assignment grades aren't released until the very end."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is really interesting and I did feel like I learned a lot. My data visualization skills and presentation creation skills have definitely improved, and I feel much more confident in my ability to give memorable and engaging presentations. Professor Franconeri is also a great lecturer who made the three hour class much more manageable. HOWEVER, there were some significant problems with this class. Mostly the fact that the syllabus changed throughout the quarter, with new assignments being added and moved around frequently. There was a decent amount of work outside of class, mostly group work with rotating groups, so the constant changing of the syllabus was very frustrating. There were also (almost) daily pop–quizzes that honestly were not necessary. They weren't hard, but the added stress just to make sure we were doing the readings felt really unnecessary to me. I do still recommend this class because it was really interesting and informative, but it would have been even better and less stressful if the syllabus remained consistent."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really interesting course and useful information for data presentation. However, extremely disorganized with the canvas page and grades. Not too difficult in terms of coursework, no tests, just a bunch of projects and assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course teaches core skills in Excel/Tableau as well as general data visualization / design thinking concepts, which I felt were immensely valuable for my career."
wnbg,psych,248,spring,Edith Chen,5.16,4.95,5.18,4.44,5.44,5.43,"I think this class is generally a well–taught class and a decently attainable one. Prof. Chen doesn't always deal with health topics super carefully (a lot of the things that are toted as ""healthy behaviors"" feels out of touch and the measurements especially so), but I thought the work load was manageable with no work except for exams. There is a LOT of required reading so prepare for that but if you do the textbook readings and go to class you should be fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course and Dr. Chen slays and the teaching was high quality. Only issue is that you have to read the textbook (NOT SKIM :() for the test and you need to remember the results of all the studies presented in class. It’s a fun, but time consuming, class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"tests were more challenging than i expected, as the material in class and the textbook are meant to be supplements to each other. i needed a decent amount of rote memorization to feel good about any given test."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was interesting and pretty easy
,,,,,,,,,,,The class consists of 3 exams. As long as you read the necessary textbook chapters and review the slides you’ll be fine. Exams have a hard–focus on the results of prior experiments
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is heavy on memorization, including from the textbook readings which are required, tested on, and not discussed in class. The readings can get repetitive at times, but you have to push through because you will be tested on it. The lecture is all about the experimental designs and results of studies, and you have to memorize the general facts about it. Not an easy A but definitely achievable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class so much. It had interesting readings, and I like that we learned about actual research studies in class. I feel like it really inspired me to stick to a healthy lifestyle and prioritize mental health. Only three exams for the overall grade, and they were very fair as long as you do what she tells you. Amazing professor who is super engaging and wants to help you outside of class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really liked this course, and it was not a ton of work. Exams were relatively straightforward and reasonable as long as you took notes and did the textbook readings. Lectures were very interesting and Prof. Chen was super engaging. Overall a great class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class, I highly recommend taking it. Whether you’re interested in health or medicine or not, you will learn so much about the psychological aspects of healthcare as well as how psychological factors like stress can really impact your health. Professor Chen is awesome, she’s very clear about her expectations and if you study for the exams they’re very straightforward– just make sure you read the textbook, it is essential to do well on the exams. I would also recommend making a separate study guide explaining all of the studies we talked about so you can keep track of them."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is super interesting! I came into it with no particular interest or understanding of health psychology, but it is super cool to learn how mental issues like stress manifest in our physical bodies. Definitely made me want to take better care of my body and mind. The exams are not too bad. Yes, you are not given much guidance on what parts of the textbook are on the exam, but Prof. Chen never tries to trick you by pulling something completely irrelevant."
,,,,,,,,,,,Learning about the cases in lecture was cool too. I do think we could have downsized the number of studies we learned about though so it wasn't like 20 per exam.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The content of this course is very interesting and Prof. Chen does a good job of going over the significance of the content. However, exams are needlessly granular on content from a very dry and un–engagingly written textbook. As a result, the students who end up doing the best end up cramming for exams using Quizlet on the relevant topics they need to memorize. This class is a class where your interest in the subject does not translate to the grade you will receive in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class!!! This was honestly one of the most interesting classes that I have taken so far, out of both psychology and non–major classes that I have taken. The content was super interesting and there is very little workload other than reading the weekly chapter assignments and studying for the 3 tests (no final). Prof. Chen also offered an extra credit opportunity at the end which was kind of fun to be honest (it was reading a health psychology paper of your choice and writing about it). This class was so low–stress yet I was excited to come to every lecture, and I loved the format of reading about the concepts in the textbook then learning about research done on those topics. The professor was super nice as well, and the tests were doable although the questions could be very specific at times. The only problem that I had with the course was that none of the lectures were recorded, but she did upload the slides promptly and I didn't really ever want to miss the lecture because of how interesting it was! If you are at all interested in psychology or medicine, be sure to take this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Take this class with Professor Chen! She’s so wonderful and very intelligent. The class is a very good one.
,,,,,,,,,,,Overall it was a fun class that talks a lot about the impact of mental state and physical health. Engaging lectures and overall its a pretty easy A as long as you go to class. A lot of the exam questions in FRQ was about specific things mentioned only in lecture.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Chen did a great job with this class and made it very easy and fun to attend. The readings are pretty straightforward and none of the topics covered in this class are extremely difficult, but the topics are very interesting to me and I feel like a lot of the health psychology topics are applicable to my own life."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a pretty easy 200–level psych elective if that's what you're looking for. I was hoping there would be more consistent discussion about social determinants of health like race, SES, gender, sexuality, etc., but there was VERY little. That was one of the weakest points of this course. I also did not enjoy the discussion of obesity, which I felt lacked nuance and did not consider the stress implications of fatphobia at all. Three non–cumulative exams (multiple choice and short answer), which weren't too bad, but there was also so much information to memorize from the slides about specific studies that you'll have to study a lot. I would say only take this course if you really want to."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is very research heavy, but is interesting. Course involves learning about approximately 18 studies for each exam. The studies are useful for understanding health psychology. Professor Chen is a great professor!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is super relevant if you're going into a healthcare profession. It's pretty easy, just three exams that aren't cumulative. It's very study–based; be prepared to memorize the set–up and results of a lot of studies and be able to recite them on an exam. All in all, a good class and not super intensive."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Much of the course's subject matter was interesting, and Professor Chen clearly cares about the subject and her students. However, lectures are just note taking for future memorization, and grade is made up of 3 exams. Outside of exam weeks, only time requirement is textbook reading and gathering study materials, before basically studying all of the material for the 1/3 of the quarter until you can recite any and all facts and studies."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great course, Professor Chen is very enthusiastic. There are three non–cumulative exams consisting of MC and free response but nothing is overly difficult, would definitely recommend taking!"
,,,,,,,,,,,The lectures were amazing
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Chen is such a lovely person! She was really enthusiastic and clearly knows the material (I believe some of the studies covered are her own). Attending class isn't mandatory as she posts the slides, but it really did help for the exam. There's 3 exams, no final (1 extra credit paper). Only downside of course is that you HAVE to read the textbook, which is time–consuming. Overall, manageable class if you put in the effort!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I found the course material more interesting than I thought it would be and a lot of the information still sticks in my head even after tests. I will say the tests are a bit hard and there are only three of them so they're each worth ~33% of your final grade. You MUST read the textbook and it's important to not miss too many classes. In class, she only goes over case studies and minor definitions of course material and you need information from the book to get a well–rounded look at the lesson and all of the multiple choice questions on the exams are directly from the book."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The content was interesting and applicable to the real world, the lectures were as engaging as they could be for a 9 am class, and the professor was nice. The exams were kind of nitpicky and definitely required you to read the book and sometimes remember very specific, random things, but overall the class was fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"this is honestly one of the harder psych classes i've taken at northwestern. which is funny because there is also the least amount of content overall. its basically just learning about how stress impacts health and how people psychologically deal with chronic disease. you DO have to read the textbook. in class, you learn about studies and the textbook is where you actually learn the terms and core info. the exams were honestly a large pain. you basically have to memorize the textbook chapters. like a short answer question will literally ask you to list 5 of the 7 reasons for xyz phenomena that were listed in a table 4.1😭 and then you also have to memorize all of the studies you learn about in class, which totals to around 15–20 per exam, because you you're asked to explain a handful of them in detail in the short answer section. if you're particularly interested in health psychology, go for it, but if you're looking for any psych class, there are definitely ones that are a lot easier and a lot more interesting/stimulating."
,,,,,,,,,,,"do not take this class. there are so many more stimulating 200 level psych classes that are also easy, but much more engaging. this class is very surface level and at times equated behaviors categorized as negative as abd in problematic way (for example, our lecture on obesity was so triggering and with no warning of the equating of food as good vs bad, describing exercise and diet linked studies etc.)"
,,,,,,,,,,,I liked learning about the different studies
,,,,,,,,,,,"At first, this class did not seem manageable – but after the first exam, you get the hang of the exam format and how to read the textbook. The exam averages jumped 10 percent between exam 1 and exam 2/3 – so hang in there. just go to class, take notes, and do the EC if offered and you'll be fine!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this course because it was typically very straightforward in its presentation of content, and the exams were what I expected. I liked the frequent mentions of prominent research and Prof Chen is a great lecturer. Take this class if you study you'll get an A."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was probably one of the most interesting and informative classes I've taken at Northwestern. The content and studies wer really interesting. I really appreciated the course was taught and Prof Chen was great, albeit a bit dry at times."
,,,,,,,,,,,"A really tough psych class and something I initially didn't want to take but I ended up liking it and I learned so much. Professor Chen was also just so great and engaging, really made the class and would recommend taking any class with her. The exams were hard but if you come to lectures and do the work, it was ok."
wnbg,psych,249,winter,Marcia Grabowecky,4.93,4.91,4.50,3.99,4.62,3.36,"Interesting course, and a super easy A for distro credit. Would recommend to anyone needing an easy 4th class for winter quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was super nice and easy! Lectures were very interesting, and we meditate during class. Super fun and interesting perspectives on meditation and how it benefits us."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very very easy distro credit, the topic is interesting from a religious standpoint, but nothing about Buddhist Psych is actually Psych heavy."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is pretty easy so if you have a psych requirement you should take this class
,,,,,,,,,,,Learned a lot about Buddhist psych. Exams are very doable—would recommend if you're interested in the subject
,,,,,,,,,,,"AMAZING class!! Very easy A, and it is also really interesting. The course content can influence your life/habits/mindset for the better as well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"While this class is undoubtedly one of the easiest distro's I have taken grading–wise, the presentation of the material is extremely disorganized. Lectures are often filled with ramblings and tangents on topics that aren't related to class and the majority of the tested material simply comes from doing the readings. That being said, Prof. Grabowecky is a passionate but quirky individual who makes this class enjoyable."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is very easy to pass––reading quizzes are the only ""difficult"" part, being roughly weekly, but the meditation logs (two total; one during the first half of the quarter, one during the second) are incredibly easy to write and the exams are open note. The exams themselves can be difficult as the formatting of the questions (like the literal canvas formatting) is sometimes... odd, but the content can all for the most part be found in lecture slides and readings. Unfortunately, this is more of a Buddhist Theology class than a psychology class, and even then, it's not a great class if theology is what you're looking for. The threads of lecture are often difficult to follow. If you're looking for an easy A, this class is great; if you're a psychology fan, maybe look elsewhere, because while psychology concepts are part of the class, they serve a small role in comparison to the extensive lectures on Buddhist thought."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I greatly enjoyed the course. The lectures were engaging and informative, the readings were fascinating, and the canvas assessments were straightforward and clear."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great low–stress course for the ethics and values distro. Grades were based on 2 meditation logs (10%), 4 canvas quizzes (10%), a midterm exam (35%), and a final exam (45%). The quizzes and exams were open–note, and the professor also held a review session for the final which was helpful. Lectures were recorded and all the slides were uploaded on Canvas. We got the potential exam essay questions beforehand, and it was definitely necessary to write out notes/bullet points for those before the exams. Professor Grabowecky is very nice and wants all her students to do well in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is definitely an easy A. Take it for your distro. Don't question it. There's a reason there's so many spots and it still fills up during pre–reg.
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a great course and I really enjoyed taking it. Professor is engaging and the content we learned was very interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is probably the easiest class I have taken at NU. However, the course content is extremely interesting and can be applied to student's lives."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a very interesting class, and the assignments aren't time consuming. There are 4 reading quizzes, 2 meditation logs, and 2 midterms (2nd midterm takes place of the final which is nice). All exams were online with ample time, and the grading was fair. Definitely took away some cool skills, and I meditate sometimes now."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class for an easy, yet fun and educational distro. DO THE READINGS! Take notes on the readings and lecture material, as the quizzes and midterm questions require you to know specifics mentioned in them. It's truly not hard to do well if you do the homework (usually takes less than 3 hours per week, the readings are super digestible). Professor Grabowecky has a soothing voice, but it can be easy to get distracted in the class so try to be attentive and try to avoid skipping. Exams are take home and she gives you the questions you need to prepare beforehand, so again, no reason you can't succeed and learn a lot about Buddhist psychology in the process."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class has 2 Canvas midterms (one before finals week), 4 (adjusted to 5) Canvas quizzes, and 2 one–page meditation logs where you just write about your experience meditating. Not a hard class. The professor mentioned wanting to remove this as a distro so that fewer people would take it. People rave about this professor, and I can't speak to her professional qualifications, but I thought the teaching was so–so."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Easy course, but you get out what you put in to it. If you are not really interested in the content, you can still get an A without going to class"
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class. Easy A and very interesting subject matter.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class! It is one of the best class in Northwestern that connects religion and psychology. The content of this class is not hard and interesting (if you are not very interested in mindfulness or psychology or Buddhism it might be a little boring). In general, a great distro/theme class to take."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overrated class. It was very easy but I was expecting a lot more when most of the CTECs claimed it was ""life–changing"" and ""eye–opening"". Open book exams. One midterm, final, 4 canvas quizzes and 2 meditation logs. Lectures are recorded. You don't need to go to class or watch the lectures to get an A. You can just have the slides open when you're doing the exams. Lecture hall was usually less than half full, barely anyone went to class by the second half of the quarter. Interesting material, but a very overrated class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed some aspects of the class, but overall I did not love the topic and therefore it was hard to enjoy the class itself."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The professor is super passionate about the subject, but this sometimes leads her to get ahead of herself during class, passing quickly through Buddhist principles that we don't necessarily know. There are a LOT of readings for this class that take a long time, and you have to actually do them because there are reading quizzes that ask very specific questions. Other than that, though, the class is not very hard. The midterm and final are open–note, and the only other assignments are the meditation logs."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course! I found the material extremely engaging and profound. It helped me rethink how I view life in a better way. Honestly, this course sometimes felt like therapy in a good way. The grading was fair and I was able to do well in the course."
,,,,,,,,,,,I enjoyed this class because it taught me a lot about a topic that I hadn't known much about before the class. It was very interesting to learn about Buddhist Psychology and the lecture slides were pretty easy to understand.
,,,,,,,,,,,Pretty straightforward course.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I had really high hopes going into this class. Unfortunately, the lectures were dry and not engaging. I struggled to pay attention in class, and the readings were dense and unnecessary. This class is an easy A, and Prof. Grabowecky is a lovely woman."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Some of the MC questions were worded a bit weirdly, but otherwise it's a low stress course. Definitely prepare for the exam essays beforehand, it will save you so much time."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good course, great prof. Definitely a class where you’ll get what you put into it, I thought it was super interesting personally. I didn’t take it as a distro but it would be a really easy one."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great course, Professor is passionate and is low pressure"
,,,,,,,,,,,Absolutely loved this class
,,,,,,,,,,,Great content that is applicable to life! Highly recommend.
,,,,,,,,,,,Incredibly relaxing class. The topics are interesting. The work load isn't bad. 10/10 would recommend.
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is a great course for the ethics distribution. The course material is interesting but I think what you get out of the class depends on what you put into the class. It is not a stressful class but lectures can be a little boring at times. Some of the readings were quite interesting though.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course takes a really deep and interesting dive into how Buddhism's tenants of loving–kindness, compassion, meditation, and mindfulness connect to concepts of psychology."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is great, but only if you REALLY are interested in buddhism. I found myself not being able to bring myself to go to class because of how boring it was at times. All the readings/material is online so showing up to class really isn't necessary. Professor Grabowecky tends to use maybe 10–12 slides per class (most of them just a white screen with some text) and proceed to talk about diffcult to follow stories that made me less and less interested in buddhism every time I went to class. Despite being listed as a psychology class, we only looked at psychology topics/ studies maybe twice the whole quarter, which was very disappointing. This class was OK at best... At least the readings were interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great course to take! Professor Grabowecky is a wonderful person and lecturer. I always enjoyed coming to lecture and hearing the stories and anecdotes that went along with her teaching. She also is very clear about the course expectations and hopes that her students take something meaningful away from the course. While I enrolled in this course for the Ethics and Values distribution requirement, I would really recommend this class to anyone!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is interesting because you learn a different way to approach the world, and I do think you could learn a lot about yourself depending on what you take from the course. The quizzes and meditation logs are not really difficult to complete, it's more so the exams that take a lot of time. Each exam has an allotted time, of which I usually had to take the whole time, but also preparing for the exams usually took me 4–6 hours. Make sure to prep and you will be fine on the exams. Additionally, Professor Grabowecky is really kind and cares about your wellbeing. She had us meditate for a short time at the beginning of every class, and it really helped towards the end of the quarter when you grew accustomed to it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was fairly interested in the class walking in, but walking out I found that I wasn't really interested in the topics that we learned. The class is a fairly easy A as long as you put the effort in (and this is a fairly low effort class relatively speaking), and I don't think there was anything egregiously uninteresting about the topics, I just think it wasn't for me."
,,,,,,,,,,,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this course. As somebody who knew nothing about Buddhism prior to taking this course, I found this course to be extremely interesting and engaging. The weekly readings were manageable and the lectures were good at expanding on the readings. Also, lecture recordings were available for those who couldn't make it to class, or wanted to go over the material again, which was highly appreciated. The grades consist of meditation logs (2–page papers), reading quizzes, a midterm, and a final exam. The midterm and final are open book and open note and are pretty fair in terms of questions and grading."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I took this course because it fulfilled an ethics distro and a credit toward my psych major, and it sounded interesting. I found the readings interesting but the lectures were not engaging and I stopped going halfway through the quarter. Easy course, but not my favorite."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought the class was slightly confusing. I understood the main Buddhist concepts because I had taken other Buddhist classes before but, if I hadn't, I doubt I would have been able to follow the class and how it was connected to psychology. The readings were really interesting and definitely the best part of the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Definitely not too hard.
,,,,,,,,,,,Pretty easy course. Very informative and did a good job not being too stressful but also being helpful.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The exams, assignments, and quizzes were all totally doable and reasonable. The lectures are super dry and the readings are needlessly long, but overall a fine class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Really enjoyed this class as an ethics distro. The daily meditation were a unique add to this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Grabowecky is one of the most compassionate professors I have ever come across at Northwestern. She genuinely cares and makes an effort to make time and discuss the material with students by opening up group discussion sessions twice a week. Being in her class feels like a therapy session sometimes. Lectures from last year have been recorded and provided for you if you cannot come to class, but oh boy you sure are missing out if you don't come. There is an abundance of material that you get to learn about that can apply to real life: happiness, compassion, etc. Even if you aren't Buddhist or religious, would definitely recommend this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,If you are not into meditation and aren't willing to learn about Buddhist Psychology then you are probably not going to enjoy this class. Take it for an easy ethics/values distro. The midterm/final is open–notes
,,,,,,,,,,,"The actual content and readings are super interesting and can be applied to your life. I'm glad I took this course and it's given me a new perspective on things. That being said, the Prof's lectures can be really hard to follow and are not very engaging. Despite the content itself being interesting, she somehow made it more boring. Still, I would recommend this class. You probably don't need to do the readings to get a good grade, but I would recommend doing them because that's where I learned to actually enjoy the content. Two open note exams, open note quizzes, and the meditation logs."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures weren't actually that engaging, however the course content was really interesting and I feel like I gained a lot from the concepts taught and the readings provided. Changed the way I think a little bit and improved my mindset I think."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The professor was very poor at engaging the audience, lectures were dry, the meditations were the one good thing about each class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you're looking for a distro that isn't time–consuming but is still valuable, consider Buddhist Psych! The only assignments are 4 multiple–choice Canvas quizzes, 2 midterms (mix of multiple choice and 2 250–300 word essay responses), two short meditation logs, and readings. The readings were mostly interesting and manageable, but occasionally long and dry. Thankfully, since the exams are open book/note, you could look back at a reading you might have skimmed. A lot of the concepts covered in class are really cool: anatman, interbeing, System 1 and System 2 thinking, empathy. This class also got me to meditate a lot more consistently! We meditated at the beginning of every class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The nicest and most easygoing ethics and values distribution class I have taken thus far. The reading are interesting if you put work into them, but you don't need to in order to get an A in this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really loved this class! I learned so much about mindset and mindfulness. I have a new way of thinking about the world and myself that definitely made this class valuable. This is also a great class to take for distros, very light course load and assignments that aren't that difficult."
,,,,,,,,,,,It was important to pick an easy enough class that will get me a good grade. It was easy. Highly recommend.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is great – easy A if you're taking this for a distro or psych requirement. 4 reading quizzes, 2 meditation logs, 2 exams that were open book with MC and two short essays. I recommend this course for someone looking for an insightful course that's also easy."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course had all the tools to be an amazing class. You learn all about meditation and get to do it for 15 minutes each class, you learn so many Buddhist values that are definitely useful to implement in your life, and much more. Unfortunately, I felt that this class was taught in a very unenthusiastic way and the Prof. didn't seem too excited about the content. Eventually, I stopped going to class because it was so hard to pay attention and there's no real reason to do so because you can literally take this course 100% online (exams, quizzes, and meditation logs were all online). I'm guessing that's what the rest of the class did too because this class has hundreds of people but by the midterm there were probably about 30–50 people in class. All in all, some of the content was cool to look at and the class is a pretty easy A but unless all you want is a GPA boost, I wouldn't really recommend this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class blew me away! I was unsure about whether I would enjoy Buddhist Psych because I am very scientifically minded and not especially spiritual, but Prof. Grabowecky had such an authentic and comprehensive approach to the topic that gave me a new appreciation for Buddhism as a philosophy. This class has totally transformed the way I think about myself and the world, and I have a feeling it will be a class that continues to impact me for many years to come. Prof. Grabowecky sets students up for success with her amazing teaching as well as the structure of assignments and assessments. The workload is very manageable while remaining challenging and engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was overall pretty worth it, as a ethics/social distro but it wasn't quite as interesting as I thought it would be, but its possible that was on me. Still worth it for the credit since it is not work–heavy or difficult, but if you have any background knowledge of Buddhism or Psych you'll probably learn less than you want to, at least that was my experience"
,,,,,,,,,,,amazing! take it. meditation has now become part of my daily routine.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class feels more like an intro to Buddhism class than a psychology class. We spent a lot of time learning about the ideals and details of Buddhism and I never really knew when we were learning about Buddhist psychology vs. just talking about Buddhism. Getting to learn about how to meditate and meditating every class was cool though. It has a relatively low workload, which was nice."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I had a friend that took this class before I did, so I kind of came in with the expectation that this class focused more on the Buddhist philosophy and way of thinking about the world than on psych you would learn in other classes. That being said, if you come into it knowing it will be slightly different to your other psych classes, I think there is a lot to learn from this class, especially for those interested in clinical psych or healthcare of some kind. The Buddhist way of thinking about the world is very different than the Western one, and I think a lot of what I learned in this class has stuck with me and made me think a little differently about the world too, so I would recommend this class to others. It's pretty easy to do well as long as you do the readings and pay attention in class, and Professor Grabowecky records lectures which is super helpful if you need to miss class or for studying. There are 4 quizzes, 2 exams, and 2 1–page meditation logs, and we finished before finals week, so this is a pretty manageable distro that I've taken a lot away from."
,,,,,,,,,,,Lectures can drag on but you get to meditate at the beginning of each class. There were two Canvas exams and one or two small assignments outside of that.
,,,,,,,,,,,Super cool concept of a class however it’s not executed fantastically. Lecture can become a bit dull when the concepts are cool. The class is 2 super easy meditation logs and 4 quizzes. Then 2 midterms. All are very durable and manageable.
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a great class that I felt taught me a lot and was honestly a great way to take a break from other challenging courses which made going to class and learning more effective and enjoyable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was really excited about this course initially, but the lectures were kind of difficult to pay attention to and the readings were long and dense. Pretty easy course, but I wish it was more engaging."
,,,,,,,,,,,"We meditated during the beginning of the class and I found it really insightful and good for my well–being. Prof. G is a really engaging lecturer and a kind soul. Definitely recommend this class. Material isn't too hard to follow and shouldn't be too hard to get an A, you probably have to try to not get an A to get an A. Great ethics & values distro."
,,,,,,,,,,,"easy and straightforward class, during class there was a 15 min meditation session every time, all exams were open notes, but readings felt really long at times, there was also 2 meditation logs"
,,,,,,,,,,,Good distro—meditate for first 15 minutes of each class which is a nice change of pace.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course is very straightforward. We had two meditation logs and Canvas quizzes and midterms you completed online open–note outside of class. Midterms had long–answer questions, but you were given all the possible questions a week prior to the test getting published, so you could always just answer the questions ahead of time and paste them day of. The content is relatively interesting, the professor is really knowledgeable and excited about it, and it genuinely took less than three hours of work a week. If you're looking for an Ethics Distro, this one is a really good choice."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The readings for this class were not super helpful –– a lot of the terms and definitions that were asked of us were sometimes pretty elusive. The lectures were also extremely boring. Instead of focusing on a couple of key concepts, the prof would drone on about random stories about her life (her husband, 20 or so stories about different trips, grocery store visits, etc.) It was hard to pay attention and no one showed up towards the end; in the off chance that she did mention something important every 30 minutes you were probably not paying attention by then. The class always starts off with a meditation, but the prof never gives proper directions for how to meditate and unless you know already, you're kind of just sleeping. With that said, the course material was decently interesting and the prof seems nice and passionate."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class because it was lower workload, and the quizzes and tests are manageable. It was also really interesting and the professor is very understanding. I really learned a lot in this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was an interesting ethics course. It wasn't as easy as I had expected, but if you put in some work studying when it comes time for exams, it is definitely easy to get a really good grade. There were bi–weekly quizzes, a midterm, and a final, so the work was manageable. Prof. Grabowecky was really nice and understanding and clearly passionate about Buddhist psych. The only thing that was difficult at times was determining which information from the lectures and readings were most important to know."
,,,,,,,,,,,Such an interesting course and a great professor and an easy A! Take the course if you're at all interested
,,,,,,,,,,,Tried to take this freshman year as my seminar so I was very happy to get to take it before graduating. A very interesting course that I think I'll remember for a long time. Challenged my way of thinking and provided some very interesting insights. 10/10I recommend it to everyone.
,,,,,,,,,,,pretty easy distro. all quizzes and midterms were open note which was pretty nice.
,,,,,,,,,,,"By taking the Buddhism course, I had an enlightening experience that allowed me to enhance my comprehension of Buddhist philosophy and its implementation in daily life. The key component of the course that resonated with me the most was the comprehensive coverage of the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, and the Three Universal Truths. This information gave me a clear framework for comprehending the core principles of Buddhism."
,,,,,,,,,,,Very fun and enjoyable course for an elective
,,,,,,,,,,,Very boring class but fair grading.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is awesome. Every class begins with meditation, which is a super nice break for mindfulness and helps you actually practice applying stuff you learned. The workload is VERY manageable, with two one–page meditation logs, two take–home exams (that ARE timed), and short multiple choice quizzes on the readings. I am a STEM major and not the biggest fan of readings, but shockingly I LOVED most of the readings for this class. The majority of them are not too long and are super interesting and insightful. Definitely take this class if you are looking for a distro, or even just if you have the room in your schedule for an extra class."
,,,,,,,,,,,easy class def take it!!
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great, low–stress course. Every check–in quiz and exam was online on Canvas and open–note, so as long as you take notes in class and do the readings, you'll be fine. I would definitely recommend taking this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was awesome
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a super easy major/minor requirement for psych. There was a lot of hype around this class so I was really excited for it at the start. Some of the readings were interesting and the meditation at the start of class was nice, however I didn't feel like I learned a lot overall. The lectures were really boring and I started not going to class and just watching them on canvas at 2x speed. For sure an easy A but sad it didn't really fulfill my intellectual curiosity."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Her voice was super annoying and the lecture is not engaging. It is the easiest class to take tho, so for psych majors, very easy A. You do have to put the work in though right before the midterm. Take this with friends for sure to make it easier, wouldn't have made it through without them"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVE this class, Professor Grabowecky is amazing and engaging, not too hefty of a workload and my mindset was genuinely enhanced greatly thanks to the lectures and curriculum"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good class if you want a good grade and not to work too hard. All of the assignments were online. The lectures were insanely dry, I stopped going a few weeks into the quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great class. I'm super interested in Buddhism and psychology, so I was hyped for this. The lectures are long (like any psych course) but so interesting. We meditated as a group for 15 minutes at the start of each class, and spent the rest of the time learning about Buddhist practices and how they impact our brain/behavior. Grades based on two midterms with MC and essays, weekly quizzes, and two meditation logs. Take this class if you're thinking about it because you'll gain some actually useful life skills. I've gotten so much better with meditation and inner focus, and I've also found I'm more able to calm myself down in moments of anxiety just by focusing on my breathing and remaining present. This class was the goat"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Easy A. The class itself was very interesting as long as you put in the effort to actually read the material. The midterm and finals were completed remotely and were very fair. Essay prompts are provided beforehand so it took a lot of stress off. I really enjoyed the meditation aspect of the class, but I felt that the lecture component got a bit dry at times."
,,,,,,,,,,,Pretty easy distro
,,,,,,,,,,,"The concepts introduced in this class were super interesting. Attendance at lectures was optional, classes were recorded, and the lecture content closely followed the assigned readings. Great distribution requirement. However, the exams did require some memorization, but they were take–home. It was sometimes hard to focus in the lectures because they were not very interactive."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is amazing, definitely one of the best (and easiest) I have taken at NU. Take this class, theres not much else to say."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a fantastic distribution requirement for ethics and values, and a great class for psych students. I recommend any psych students trying to to this class to consider pre registering, as this class can fill up kinda quickly."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It helped me reflect and adjust myself so that I can better my time management, stress, and lifestyle."
,,,,,,,,,,,"While this class is relatively easy, I don't recommend taking it unless it's something you're truly interested in. I think the course had a lot of potential to be really interesting, but Professor Grabowecky isn't the most engaging lecturer and reading are very dense and dry. There are 2 meditation logs and an open–note midterm and final (which require some preparation, but aren't too difficult if you make study guide). I had higher hopes for Buddhist psych, but I think a much smaller class size might have made it more interesting and easy to be engaged."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I feel that many concepts in Buddhist psych are so eye–opening and inspiring, and I would recommend Buddhist psych to people interested in counseling psychology/stress reduction, since it provides a brand new way to look at many things in this world and makes things that I once grasped on seem so unimportant. However, I do think that the Professor's slides are a bit disorganized and do not really align with what she's saying, which makes it hard to follow her lecture. Some lectures also focused too much on cognitive psychology and the connection between Buddhist psych was not very clear."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I heard a lot of good things about this course as a distro. It is very easy to get an A, but I felt like the lectures were kind of boring. You can learn a lot about Buddhist Psychology in the class though. The quizzes are very simple and the exams are easy as well. The possible exam questions are given beforehand so you can prep them before the exams. The meditations at the start of each lecture though were very calming and peaceful."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, this class was pretty manageable. The workload was fair –– I liked that we built up from small, low–stakes quizzes to two bigger take–home exams. I also found the class material very interesting and inspiring. Professor Grabowecky's lectures might not be the most engaging –– as it is a very large class –– but they are very informative."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Easy A. 2 meditation logs, 2 take–home exams, a few canvas quizzes, and the lectures are recorded."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was very boring and sadly did not make me more interested in Buddhism at all.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was disappointed with this course. I had heard great things from other students, and I had an interest in Buddhist Psych before entering the class. However, this is overwhelmingly a Buddhist Theology course not Buddhist Psychology. About 75% of lectures are on theology, and have almost no relation to Psychology. Dr. Grabowecky is also a boring lecturer, with disorganized and often unhelpful slides. The class is an easy A, but that's about it."
wnbg,psych,303,fall,Renee Engeln,5.87,5.65,5.76,5.35,5.92,6.48,"Renee's psychopathology is a dream. Lectures are like coming to a TED talk every day, super engaging. She makes you want to love the material and teaches it in such an interesting, multifaceted way. The exams can be challenging and specific but still a great class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Renee is great! you will learn so much in this course.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The best psychology class I have taken so far. Be sure to take this class with Engeln. If debating between this class and others, without a doubt take this one, and you will be glad you did."
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a great class. You have to stay on top of your readings and materials but it is well worth the effort. Renee is the best professor I've had at Northwestern.
,,,,,,,,,,,Take this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,Super interesting and fun class! Renee is awesome and engaging.
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class and Renee rocks!
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was really fascinating and informative, and the content feels important and applicable outside of the course. Renee is helpful and engaging, and we read a lot of recent articles along with the textbook readings, which made the content feel more interesting and relevant. I would highly recommend this course to psychology majors and minors, or to anyone who is interested."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Engeln is the best professor i have had at NU. Highly recommend taking any class with her, especially this one"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was definitely one of the best psychology classes I've taken. Professor Engeln is the best –– this class is pretty content–heavy, but she guides us through it and encourages us to consider difficult, sometimes stigmatized topics in bias–free, compassionate perspectives. There were three exams and four informed–response assignments that focused on these topics discussed in class, and I felt they pretty fairly assessed our understanding of the material. As long as you pay attention to lectures, do the readings, and take notes using the review questions handouts that structured everything nicely, you'll do well."
,,,,,,,,,,,Take this class you won't regret it.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class if you can! Renee is such an incredible professor who truly cares about the well–being of her students. She’s very knowledgeable, approachable, and easy to talk to. This course does require a lot of reading (2 chapters a week and some articles), but you will do well as long as you complete all the review questions. There are 3 exams and 4 IRs. I just wish there were more opportunities to raise your grade, as most of the grade was based on exam scores, so one poor exam score can make it hard to recover."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Psychopathology with Renee is likely my favorite course at Northwestern. If you have any interest in learning more about mental disorders, this class is for you. Renee is also the most incredible professor and person. This is a great class. The readings can be hard to stay on top of, and the exams are not easy, but Renee does her best to set students up for success."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course. I found the topic very interesting, so I think I retained a lot of information. It was also extremely helpful when Professor Engeln gave us review questions that laid out the most important topics for us to focus on. We covered a wide scope of topics so it was really helpful to have this guide to help me know what to focus on. The textbook was great because it was online, which usually I don't like, but it had an audio version which meant I could listen to it on 2.5x speed while I read along. This helped me so much when reading the textbook. Professor Engeln also pulled recent articles related to the topics. I found the articles fun to read and informative. It was especially nice to see how I as a journalist could potentially combine psychology and journalism."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was fantastic! It was really well organized, and the expectations for exams and assignments were extremely clear from the start. If you attended lectures, did the readings, and completed the review questions as a study tool, you were pretty much guaranteed to do well in this course, since the exams only covered material that was mentioned in the review questions. Lectures were great and very engaging because Renee has a great lecture style, which made it really easy to sit through the full lecture without getting bored or distracted. Additionally, the content was very interesting and super important––not just for psych majors/minors but for anyone looking to better understand mental illness. She clarified so many misconceptions about mental disorders and treatments that I didn't even know I held before taking the course. Additionally, she did a great job being transparent about the state of the field of psychiatry and discussing the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to mental disorders. Rather than just stating her opinions regarding different issues, she took an approach rooted in evidence, and encouraged us to do the same."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a solid, but tough class. Professor Engeln is a great professor who is engaging and informative. It was easy to go to lecture, which was essential if you wanted to do good on the test. However, the book is also heavily tested on, so you should skim through it before each exam. I'd say it's about 40% book material and 60% lecture. One thing I'd say about this class is that you need to be on top of the review questions and all the information, since it is a lot. I also had this professor for psych 110 and that was easy so I thought this class would also be easy, but there's a lot more in–depth content and the exam questions are also more difficult. However, overall the class isn't too bad, and as long as you stay on top of the information, you're guaranteed to do well."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was super interesting, and the workload was reasonable. Going to lecture is helpful for exams, same with doing the review questions. Other than that you don't need to do too much for studying, so if you pay attention and do a good job on the review questions you'll be good for exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is AMAZING. Prof. Renee is fabulous, as always — she's great at engaging us in lecture, answering questions, offering clarifications in office hours, and assigning interesting readings. The readings could be substantial, so try to avoid leaving them til the night before the lecture — space them out instead. The lecture content was very interesting and debunked a lot of misconceptions I came into the class with about mental health. My only issue (it's a small one) was that sometimes some of the readings offered contradictory arguments/hypotheses than other readings or the lecture content, but I was able to resolve these clarifications by going to office hours. I highly suggest going to office hours to help with understanding the sometimes extensive readings and making sure you're on the right track with the informed responses assignments and exam studying."
,,,,,,,,,,,Renee was actually the best prof. She is so knowledgeable and engaging and kind. You can tell she wants everyone to learn all of the material and succeed and she does an amazing job of walking the line of taking this very serious subject very seriously and making it fun and exciting.
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a really good class! What you need to know for exams is outlined in the review questions and exams felt fair. Lectures are engaging and the course material is interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Renee is an amazing professor that keeps her lectures engaging. The course and the assignments are designed to help you study and do well on the exams. The exams are pretty straightforward, and you will do well in the class as long as you take good notes and do the readings, and review for the exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a great class. Renee is absolutely wonderful and I would really recommend taking it with her. She's a great and engaging lecturer and overall a very nice person. You should also definitely go to her office hours if you take this class, she was always very helpful and nice in those. The exams are a little bit hard, but as long as you do the review questions and go to class you should be fine. The textbook readings took me awhile so eventually I ended up just skimming the textbook readings to find the review question answers and that worked well for me, so I would recommend doing that. You definitely have to do work in this class though to get a good grade, or at least I did. But overall, super great class, and I would recommend to psych majors of course but also people who aren't psych majors because it's just a really interesting class"
,,,,,,,,,,,BEST PSYCH COURSE I'VE TAKEN SO FAR!!!!! Renee was such an incredible teacher and is so knowledgable about the subject.
,,,,,,,,,,,Class is really good. But tests are HARD. I would study around 12–14 hours for a test and still get like a 90. Renee is AMAZING though. Like by far the best teacher I have ever had at Northwestern. Class would be my absolute favorite class if the tests were not so hard. Only three tests which is nice and 4 short response assignments. There is also just SO MUCH material that is pure memorization.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a MUST TAKE course!! Does not matter whether you are a psych major/minor or not, you learn so much and Renee is an amazing professor. This is the first class at Northwestern where I not once dreaded going to class or doing the reading. It is quite a bit of work (lots of reading for each exam) but I promise that it is all worth it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As most people already know, Renee is an amazing professor. I really enjoyed taking this course with her and I found that getting a good grade was pretty manageable if you attended lectures, took notes, and used the review questions she provides. I liked that this course not only taught me about the basics of diagnosis and classification of mental disorders but also about the current problems the field of psychopathology faces in both understanding and diagnosing mental disorders."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was solid not that much work but the readings can be kinda long. Exams are't too bad. Not a bad class and the professor is great, take this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked the professor. She is passionate and engaging. However, this was one of the most difficult courses I have taken. There is so much material covered it feels impossible to remember it all. The tests are horribly written. Some questions made no sense (I would have no idea what she was asking) and others were never covered in class. I could study weeks beforehand and still fail exams. I have never felt so mentally drained in a course and lost my passion for psychology. I have taken 3 courses with Renee before and never again. She is a great person but she needs to structure her classes more properly. I did not feel like I learned anything because I was so stressed most of the time."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was very well organized. The readings, while time–consuming, were interesting. The professor was always prepared and provided adequate material to do well on exams. Only complaint I had were the response papers throughout the quarter. They were graded very harshly and I did worse on all of them than on any of the exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,Engeln is the best psych professor as always but be prepared for difficult exams
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a really fascinating, interesting, and thought–provoking class. Renee is a fantastic professor who teaches with such enthusiasm and passion you can't but help become deeply interested in the material. Also, her office hours are so fun! But... This is an insanely hard class. The TAs are decent but harsh and the tests are just another level. Hats off if you can get an A in this class but be prepared to put a ton of work in without expecting results to match. In no way do I regret taking the course I just wish it was more forgiving lol."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is an awesome class! Exams are super manageable in my opinion if you are thorough with your review questions. Otherwise, the content was super interesting and not really that much work outside of weekly readings and studying for the three exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was an amazing, albeit somewhat hard, class. Renee is an outstanding professor, and always kept me engaged and interested during lectures. The subject content itself was fascinating, and I really found myself looking forward to not only going to class, but also reading the textbook which was easy to unpack and understand. The one thing I would advise people is that this class is NOT an easy A. Renee's tests are difficult. It always seems like there's more than one right answer to the MCQ's, and for me at least, it's hard to do well. The informed response papers do help provide a bit of a grade boost, as long as you take your time and are thorough with them. Don't be expecting an easy class when you sign up for this, but I would definitely still recommend it if you're interested in the subject or are looking for a stimulating, thought provoking class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was super interesting. Professor Engeln was an amazing lecturer; she was clearly knowledgeable about the subject matter and made sure to give us a realistic view of the field. The textbook readings could be a bit lengthy and hard to get through, but the other readings were interesting. The tests were very fair and easy to study for, but studying is definitely required."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Renee is the best professor I've had at Northwestern, and probably ever, hands down. She is a brilliant lecturer, always keeping me (and everyone else in the class) extremely engaged and excited about the material. She knows what she's talking about, and is always ready to answer questions. Despite being kind of burnt out with academics, I felt excited every day I had class to come and learn about psychology. On a personal note, along with being incredibly smart, Renee is also very kind and really cares about her students. I took Psych 110 with Renee. Though this class was MUCH harder to do well in (less extra credit, accuracy rather than completion on the homework, etc) I enjoyed it just as much (maybe even more) due to the subject matter. Don't expect to get an easy A in this class, but it is well worth it given what I learned."
,,,,,,,,,,,"One of the best classes I've taken at Northwestern! I think this is a class almost everyone should take, especially because it does so much to teach and correct basic misconceptions about various mental disorders. I don't think we really went in–depth about any one disorder, but it did a good job of teaching the basics of most of the major disorders. I would definitely recommend taking this class with Professor Engeln! She's very engaging, and really cares about making sure students succeed. The study guides in this class are monsters, so I would definitely start on them early."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was such a good class! Renee is such an engaging lecture – her lectures conveyed a lot of information without making us feel too overwhelmed. She is really helpful and warm during office hours as well. I would say the exams for this class were quite hard. You really need to take good notes during the lecture, do all the readings, and do the review questions. It's not an easy class but definitely worth it if you put in the effort!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Love the topic, although some discussions were emotionally heavy, so be prepared for that. If you're interested and do some studying/fill out the review questions you'll do fine! I really enjoyed the format of the written assignments, they are made to be applicable to the real world. Love Renee!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was taught very well (I love Renee). The exams were fair, and the assignments (short writing pieces) weren't too difficult, but the grading was quite strict."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course honestly disillusioned me with the field of psychology (not a significant problem since I wasn't planning on studying much more anyways). Yet, I still felt that it taught some information that can be extremely helpful in understanding and aiding others."
,,,,,,,,,,,great class. took this to learn more about my own mental wellbeing (or lack thereof) but came out with so much more knowledge than I thought I would.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this course and enjoyed most of the readings. It definitely is not easy or by any means an easy A. The tests are tough and there is no extra credit. Even still, I enjoyed Renee's teaching and the course overall. Super interesting but difficult."
,,,,,,,,,,,Renee is one of the best professors I've had. She is so enthusiastic and makes the class very interesting and stimulating. I honestly enjoyed being in class and the time went by very quickly since the material and Renee's teaching was so great. I highly recommend this class!
,,,,,,,,,,,Renee and this class are both great! 3 exams and 4 assignments that we had plenty of material to review for. I found the exams to be somewhat difficult but others seemed to do well.
wnbg,psych,303,winter,Vijay Mittal,5.57,5.54,5.58,4.73,5.57,3.71,"This course is absolutely amazing and has a very low workload. There are only two exams and an optional extra credit paper the entire quarter, and the exams are meant to test your knowledge, not trick you. They also are remote, which is helpful. Prof. Mittal is one of the best lecturers I have ever had. He makes sure to pull out the most important information while intertwining it with real life experiences which helps with retaining the information. The class contains a lot of highly valuable information about mental illnesses (including anxiety, depression, personality disorders, substance use disorders, and schizophrenia) which are both incredibly interesting and good to know in general. I would highly, highly recommend taking this class if given the chance"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Mittal is one of the best lecturers I've had at this school, and he made class so enjoyable and manageable. I learned a ton and am so glad I took this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was pretty decent. Prof Mittal is super knowledgeable on the topic. The class is basically 2 tests, the final was harder than the midterm for sure tho. Overall its a solid psych class to take for the major/minor"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is an interesting course and a relatively easy A (or at least an easy A–). Lectures are not recorded even though they easily could be, which is frustrating for when you need to miss class. Overall a good course with a cool prof though."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Mittal is AMAZINGGG! Please take this class. He is such an engaging instructor – you will have no trouble paying attention to the lectures, especially if you're anywhere remotely interested in abnormal psych. I would love to take more classes with him. Exams were basically our entire grade but took place online locked–down browser so a little less stressful if you prefer that format. Exams were also not too difficult as long as you paid attention in class, skimmed the book more or less, and attended the review session. He underlines all the material that will be on the exam so that's SUPER helpful. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Loved this class with Prof. Mittal! He underlines key terms that will show up on the exam which makes it so much easier to sit and enjoy the content he is teaching. Only 2 exams, which are pretty easy if you go to class and take good notes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"THE BEST CLASS I'VE TAKEN AT NU!!! I'm actually so sad this class is over! Mittal is incredible, clearly so knowledgeable and loves answering questions with real life examples. He makes this class as easy as possible (2 online non–cumulative exams and an optional extra credit book report) so that you can just enjoy the content, which was amazing! 100/10"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think that Professor Mittal is an incredible lecturer who clearly is passionate about psychopathology as a field. The content is interesting to begin with, but his lecture style made going to class so much more enjoyable. He underlines everything that you need to know on the slides, and the midterm and final exams are very straight forward. These exams are timed and online, so you can take it at any point during the day before the day ends."
,,,,,,,,,,,Really great course –– 2 midterms and an extra credit paper. Very manageable workload. Prof. Mittal is great. I loved the lectures.
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Mittal was a very engaging professor and he underlined all of the testable content on the slides. The exams were pretty straightforward
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a really interesting class. Mittal is a great professor. The class structure is very relaxed, and so it is easy sometimes to not take it as seriously as other classes when things get busy. You get out of it what you put in, and in my experience I didn't put much in so I didn't actually get much out of it. The exams were easy and the course material was straightforward."
,,,,,,,,,,,absolutely loved this course and love mittal –– he really just cares about your learning the material and not memorizing random non–useful facts. he tells you exactly what you are going to be tested on and gives you interesting context that you don't necessarily need to take notes on but can just listen to and absorb. He is also just very honest and real about how these things are presented in our day to day lives and our common inaccurate perceptions. EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS AT SOME POINT. it's really awesome
,,,,,,,,,,,This course is well structured and easy to succeed in. Prof. Mittal is a great lecturer and very fair with his grading system.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class with Vijay!! He is such a great professor, only two exams and he underlines everything that will be tested. He cares so much about students and making sure they enjoy his class instead of just focusing on the facts. Lectures are super engaging with lots of videos and he also has cool stories to tell throughout the quarter"
,,,,,,,,,,,i liked it. lots on schizo which i love to see myself represented
,,,,,,,,,,,"great class, but did not like how we only had 2 exams and 1 extra credit paper."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Mittal is so passionate about this subject, so it was great to learn from him! The class has a very minimal workload. One midterm and a final – very straightforward."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Mittal is very knowledgeable and experienced in psychopathology, and it was a pleasure to listen to his lectures. He approached mental illness with a caring perspective and included a lot of personal anecdotes from his time in clinical psychology which were very interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,I believe that the classes were informative and interesting while the tests were fair and did not try to trick the students; Professor Mittal emphasizes that students should develop true knowledge in topics rather than just studying for a grade.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was such an interesting class, and I genuinely feel like I learned a lot! Professor Mittal is extremely knowledgeable and approachable, and the TAs were very helpful outside of class as well. I appreciate how Professor Mittal was willing to adjust his instruction after getting feedback halfway through the quarter. I wish there were more to your grade than just the two exams because I'm not a great test–taker, but all things considered, the exams were manageable and fair so I can't complain too much. I definitely recommend reading the textbook to supplement the lecture material."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The professor made lectures engaging, and for the most part, the two tests were not bad. The final accompanied a major time constraint, however."
,,,,,,,,,,,Would recommend this course! It is so interesting learning about different disorders each week and discussing example videos. Two exams and one extra credit paper. Take this class with Prof. Mittal if you can!
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was very cool and I feel like I learned a lot from it. All the concepts were explained really well in lecture too.
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Mittal is a great lecturer who is clearly passionate about what he teaches. He makes this class very engaging and hearing about his work in the field is very interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,This is an awesome course. The material is interesting and presented in an easy to understand way
,,,,,,,,,,,"Even though I didn't particularly excel in this class, I learned so much from prof mittal. His lectures were so insightful and engaging and the material was of course relevant and deep. I don't love that our entire grade is based off of two exams, but they are both take home lockdown browser so it's not as anxiety filled as an in person exam. Prof Mittal is the sweetest, most genuine professor ever!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"An overall great class!! I thought Vijay was an amazing professor. He was very knowledgeable about so many of the disorders and made the lecture pretty engaging. The class is very straightforward: two exams and one extra credit paper. Vijay underlines everything you need to know on the exam in his lecture slides, which is really nice and allows you to enjoy parts of the lecture without having to worry about writing everything down. Everything on the exam is basically from the slides with a few parts from the textbook. I also learned a lot about many of the common mental disorders that people face. Loved this class and would definitely recommend it with Vijay!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is so so interesting. From personality disorders to the impact of drugs on the brain, you learn about so many cool/niche psych concepts. It was also very easy –– just a midterm and a final and you don't really need to do the textbook readings to do well on either. The pacing was a bit off sometimes like some lectures I felt like we were rushing through concepts and some we spent the whole time on one or two disorders, but overall I thought the lecturing was really engaging and Prof. Mittal is really great."
,,,,,,,,,,,loved this course!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely take this course with Professor Mittal! He's super knowledgeable and enthusiastic about this subject. I took a lot of psych classes before this at NU, but this was by far my favorite."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I love psychology courses, and this was one of my favorites I have taken his far at Northwestern. It was a great balance of lecture, questions, and videos and really helped me comprehend the topic"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Loved this class with Vijay!!! There's barely any grades because there's no assignments, just 2 non–cumulative take–home exams that may be challenging if you don't go/pay attention in class (he didn't record lectures), and an optional extra credit paper. But the material itself was extremely interesting, especially because Vijay shares a lot of relevant anecdotes from both his clinical and research experience, and he also shows a lot of engaging videos and graphics to supplement the material, so I loved going to class and felt like I learned a lot in general."
,,,,,,,,,,,Love the Professor please take it with prof Vijay
,,,,,,,,,,,"Awesome class. One midterm, one final, Mittal is great. Really fascinating."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Mittal is an amazing professor who shows such empathy for people struggling with mental illnesses. The amount of knowledge and experience he has in the field was extremely impressive. The material itself is very interesting and he is a great lecturer. He showed interesting videos and indicated what material would be on the exams, making note–taking and studying much easier. The only ""homework"" was the readings, which I personally didn't do, as some of them were long, and I was fine. Take this class!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Mittal is the best ever. He is so knowledgable on the topic and wants everyone to learn as much as possible. He is so easy going and nice, and only two exams the whole quarter. He wants everyone to pass the class with ease."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great professor and explains the material very well. Interesting subject matter and well paced. Two tests as the entire grade make an A a bit tough.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class and can't recommend it enough. Prof Mittal is very passionate about this subject and it shows in his explanations of the various disorders we discussed. He underlines all the material that will be tested on, so you can actually enjoy the lectures instead of trying to write everything down. He tends to ramble but he has built–in catch–up days so he's technically never behind. There is 1 midterm, 1 final, and a 5–6 page double–spaced extra credit paper. Since there isn't much cushion for your grade, I'd say do the paper. Definitely take this class as a distro or major/minor req and take it with Mittal."
,,,,,,,,,,,The information presented in the course was really interesting and definitely impacted how I view mental health disorders. Professor Mittal included many helpful videos during lecture to explain his points but sometimes the slides didn't contain all of the important details. The underlined concepts were sometimes inadequately explained or brushed over so there were times during class when I was confused in class. The tests were fair and classes were engaging!
,,,,,,,,,,,Very interesting class but sometimes the professor goes off topic and it gets difficult to focus in class
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a really interesting course but just like other psych classes it is a lot of content. You learn about many different psychological disorders that are extremely interesting to understand. There are only two noncumalative midterms but they each weigh 50% of your grade which is a lot so you do have to work hard for the midterms. I did enjoy the class but you have to be willing to put in the work to do well.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a good psych class. The exams were a bit daunting but Prof. Mittal underlines what is testable in the slides which is helpful, and he/the TAs offer practice questions and vignettes. The textbook is a little long at times but usually the material is covered again in class. Prof. Mittal does have a tendency to go over, but he builds in extra days."
wnbg,psych,303,spring,Vijay Mittal,5.69,5.55,5.64,4.89,5.74,3.61,"Overall, this was a good class and Mittal is a really good lecturer, but there are only two tests worth 50% of your grade (and there is one extra credit opportunity). Although his lectures are really good, I don't think they are good enough to justify only two tests worth 50%. Overall though really good content and it is very interesting"
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof. Mittal is wonderful and so excited by this topic. He teaches really well and emphasizes empathy in the field. He is also very approachable and open to working with students.
,,,,,,,,,,,take this class!! Professor Mittal is one of the most impressive people I have ever met. He genuinely is interested that his students learn and explain the disorders with such passion. This course gave me necessary perspective on psychopathological disorders.
,,,,,,,,,,,By far one of my favorite courses at Northwestern. Professor Mittal was incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic about teaching the content
,,,,,,,,,,,"Content is super duper interesting and Mittal is a really good lecturer. It is a bit dense, and most of your grade is based on 2 exams, but if you study and put the work in it is definitely doable. here's also extra credit"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is an AMAZING COURSE, love the material and the prof plus it is super chill literally only two exams (both are reasonable) and an extra credit essay"
,,,,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed this class. The only assignment was an optional extra credit that I did out of interest; Vijay never assigned any busywork and made everything very relevant
,,,,,,,,,,,"DO TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROF. MITTAL!!! He is amazing! The topic of psychopathology is hard, but Prof. Mittal made it extremely interesting, with lots of examples, and humorous instruction. PROF. MITTAL IS THE BEST OF THE BEST!!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was really good! Very manageable workload (1 chapter per week) and 2 tests that are take home and are pretty straightforward and not stressful. The lectures are really interesting especially if you are interested in the topic.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great course!! Super interesting content with a reasonable workload. Lecture slides are provided and key points for exams are underlined. Definitely recommend this course, especially for majors and minors."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is great! Professor Mittal is very passionate about the subject and keeps the course engaging. The grading is based entirely on two exams and one extra credit assignment but they are very fair, and it is clear how to do well. The content is super interesting. I highly suggest reading the book. It helps a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,easy A but a kinda boring class. Vijay is so sweet and nice and funny but lectures are a little bit dry. 2 take home online exams that are fine but you will not learn much if you do not go to every class and study.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very straightforward psych class. Mittal is a great lecturer that adds a lot of additional info and background information while lecturing. All the material you need to know is underlined on his slides, so it was very easy to study for exams. Exams are not meant to trick you, and it is very doable to do well on them. Easy to get an A, but if you want to play it safe you can also write a 5–page extra credit paper."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was very interesting and informative. CTECs made me underestimate the test itself. It's not an EASY A, but an attainable one."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class and even better professor. Only an online midterm and final plus an extra credit paper. Lectures had underlined terms that indicated what was on the exams.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class. Professor Mittal is a great lecturer and never made class feel boring. Assuming you're interested in the class topic, I highly recommend this course. There's two exams that aren't too difficult if you attend lecture and study. Honestly, the textbook readings aren't necessary. There's also an extra credit paper that isn't too difficult either."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Mittal was amazing! He made a lecture–based class very engaging by playing videos, always allowing people to ask questions and being very enthusiastic about the topic. The class consists of a midterm and a final which were not bad."
,,,,,,,,,,,"super interesting course! highly recommend taking if you have an interest in psych, bio, medicine, or anything of that kind."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is very easy. Mittal is a great lecturer and makes the class very chill and laid back, so you can enjoy the material being presented. The only grades are two exams, so you have to do well on them but they are typically fair."
,,,,,,,,,,,"While the conditions taught in this course can sometimes be difficult to learn about, I am very glad that I did. This course was well taught and the prof is so knowledgeable and brings in information from his firsthand experience which I appreciated."
,,,,,,,,,,,I really enjoyed this class. I was very interested in every lecture. I really enjoyed the material that was being taught which is why I think that I enjoyed lectures so much. I think that Prof. Mittal is great!
,,,,,,,,,,,Only grades are two non cumulative exams that are online and not too hard. Professor is highly engaging and cares a lot about the topic! Overall great class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Mittal is one of the best professors I have had so far. He is extremely helpful, is happy to answer 150 questions if you have them, and makes learning the content so much fun. The class itself was really interesting with two exams and 1 extra credit paper so it was very manageable. Definitely do the readings before class and take good notes it will really help while studying for the exams."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class. If you're a psych or neuro major, DEFINITELY take this class. Every little bit of content taught was fascinating (maybe that's my bias), and Prof Mittal is the best. He's such a great person and mentor, is so clearly well–intentioned and wants the best for all his students. Not to mention, he is super funny. In terms of the actual coursework, the entire grade is based on 2 exams (not cumulative), and there is the option of an extra credit essay due at the end of the quarter to provide a buffer. The exams were online and closed–book. If you go to lecture and read the textbook (especially focusing on key concepts highlighted by the book), you will certainly get an A."
,,,,,,,,,,,Best Prof ever so caring. Go to office hours for help/advice. Content is so interesting and meaningful.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think this course is definitely worth taking. It teaches you about a lot of the basic psychological disorders, personality disorders, substance abuse, and even some of the neuroscience behind this topic. I thought the material was very manageable but I didn't like that we were only graded on two exams that were 50% of our grade each. I don't perform the best on exams and don't feel like it helped me interact with the material all that much. The professor was great though and very good at keeping the lectures light–hearted and educational."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Mittal is very understanding and patient with lecturing content. Grade consists of two closed book take–home exams and an extra credit paper with super flexible topics. Lectures/slides are recorded.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I LOVED this course!!! Prof. Mittal is so incredibly engaging and handles the material with great compassion and empathy. The class consists of two take–home (closed note) exams and an extra credit paper, so it's very low–stress. Part of me wishes we were graded on more because I'm worried I did not do as well on the final as I would've liked. But even so, it's still a great course, and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in understanding mental disorders better. I can't speak for the other professors that teach this course, but Prof. Mittal was amazing."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class isn't an easy A but an A– is doable. Your grade is based on two online exams and if you want you have the option to do an extra credit paper. It is hard to get an A without doing the extra credit paper. You must submit a draft for the paper by the midterm and it is based on a book that you have to read. Prof Vijay is awesome and a great lecturer. You really learn a lot about mental health.
,,,,,,,,,,,Loved this class so much. He understands what leading should be. I felt like I learned more because I was not so worried about doing well !
,,,,,,,,,,,"only 2 exams,, slides posted to canvas"
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you like lecture classes and clinical psych, you’ll love this course. Professor Mittal is great at lecturing on these topics and answering questions in class/during office hours. Two online exams (midterm and final) and an optional extra credit essay based on a book of your choice."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great professor. Funny! 2 non–cumulative exams. Professor Mittal is very fair, a great lecturer, and is so passionate and informed on the subject. Just all around a great class and a great professor."
,,,,,,,,,,,Really good psych class! Prof Mittal is very knowledgable and makes the lectures very interesting
,,,,,,,,,,,This is a very interesting course and professor Mittal is great.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Super interesting class with relatively low stress! I feel like I learned a lot during lecture but didn't feel overwhelmed, and the extra credit opportunity is really nice and allows you to dig deeper into any topic you're more interested in."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Easy class. Super interesting subject material and only two tests that are at home, lockdown browser."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Amazing course. I definitely recommend, no matter if you are a psych major or not. Professor Mittal is a leader in his field of Schizophrenia Research, so great opportunity to learn."
,,,,,,,,,,,Best class I’ve taken at northwestern. Fascinating content and very light workload. Vijay is goated
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Mittal is great. He is so knowledgeable, presents the information passionately and empathetically, and really just cares about all of his students learning. There are literally only two tests, which are't too bad if you pay attention and take notes during lectures, and he even gives an optional extra credit paper. He really wants his students to succeed, and the info we learned was so interesting!"
wnbg,psych,306,fall,Alissa Chung,5.79,5.62,5.62,5.24,5.70,5.35,"This class was extremely interesting and effective in teaching me about clinical psychology as a career or area of research. Professor Chung's lectures are incredible, and she teaches the material with a great deal of expertise. The grading is pretty fair as well. I highly recommend going to office hours not only to clarify any confusion, but talking to Professor Chung is always very pleasant"
,,,,,,,,,,,"One of my favorite classes at Northwestern! Solidified my plans to get a PhD and become a clinical psychologist. Prof. Chung is an absolute inspiration. If you are anything like me, you will be hanging on to her every word and aching for more stories from her own clinical practice! It is fascinating to learn about different clinical orientations, from family systems to dialectical behavior therapy to psychoanalysis. I wouldn't say there is a strong sense of community in the class – most people just keep to themselves. There aren't a lot of interactive activities either, but it's totally fine because the lectures are so engaging. Honestly, I would suggest taking notes by hand so that you can fully soak up the lesson. You can get by with skimming a lot of the readings – just focus on the italicized terms and the review boxes. The exams are kind of stressful, as some of the questions are real curveballs from the textbook (usually only one or two). The short answer section usually gives you a case and asks you how you would respond as a clinician. The papers are also quite challenging (final has a big research focus), but they are manageable as long as you ask for help. Office hours are great and Prof. Chung is super happy to give you career advice! LOVE LOVE"
,,,,,,,,,,,Good class and great professor. 2 essays and 2 exams
,,,,,,,,,,,I really liked lectures but the readings were super long and pretty boring at times
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is so much fun. I am very interested in the topic before I registered so I might be biased. the class is structured so that you get to learn some of each therapy. Alissa is always accommodating, she has so much passion and knowledge for the class. Highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There are 2 exams [midterm and final], and 2 paper [case paper and research paper]"
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof Chung is amazing! I recommend this class! It isn't very high commitment and the material is quite interesting. There were 2 papers and 2 exams for the class. It is very possible to do really well in the class and Prof Chung is very supportive of students and is always willing to help if you are struggling!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Chung brings a lot of energy into lecture. Exams are based on lecture and textbook readings only, though, so the other articles assigned for class seemed unnecessary. Papers weren't too difficult, either, with the first analyzing an imaginary person's case through one of the theoretical lenses and the other on a topic of choice in clinical research/intervention or cultural factors in clinical psychology. Definitely go to office hours when writing the papers, though, since I missed a few points on the first paper over the organization of my paper."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was fantastic! Levy Chung is truly one of the best psych teachers at Northwestern and is so kind and understanding. She will bend over backwards to help her students, and has enough passion to keep you awake at 9:30 AM in the morning. Really enjoyed this course! Only downside – The exams were pretty tough, and some of the multiple choice were a bit unfair... But I would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I can't imagine what it would be like to take this class if you don't have a strong–ish inclination that you might want to be a therapist. I knew that that's my career path, so I absolutely loved this class, one of my favorites I've taken at NU. It does get into some finer details though, which if you're just testing the waters without ever really having thought about therapy before I'd guess it would be boring. You need to do the readings in a pretty involved way, you've gotta go to class. Professor Chung is phenomenal, I've taken a couple classes with her and she's one of the best professors at this school."
,,,,,,,,,,,Loved this course. Lots of content but it was all super interesting. The readings go well with the lectures and Professor Chung made the lectures engaging and has very clear expectations. She is very approachable and knowledgeable. Highly recommend this course
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was very interesting and useful if you're interested at all in clinical psych (which includes a lot more occupations than just therapy!), especially with Prof. Chung, who has a LOT of experience in the field and can answer most questions. It's not too much work, it's lectures, 2 exams, a decent amount of reading, and 2 short essays (the grading on the essays didn't seem too harsh either). I wish I hadn't spent so much time reading the non–textbook readings because, even though they were interesting, the exams really only asked about the content from the lectures and textbook and I wish I had just spent my time studying those instead."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was AMAZING. Professor Chung is the best, and the course was extremely interesting. It is a must take out of the psychology courses here! There were two exams and two papers, all of which were extremely fair if you pay attention in class. Definitely take this class, it as great!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Chung is really really nice and understanding like you can talk to her about anything. Her lectures are also very engaging. One thing I don't like about this course though is I don't really know what to expect on exams. It might just be me but I think the stuffs that I studied don't come up in the multiple choices questions.
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Chung is the BEST!!! This class was so engaging and the material so interesting. Professor Chung brought in a lot of real life examples that were a great way to learn. Her tests were fair and he papers very interesting. You had a lot of freedom with the essays which I was personally a big fan of being able to write about what I wanted to.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is one of the best psych classes I have taken at Northwestern besides psychopathology and child psychopathology. Professor Chung is a phenomenal professor as well as her TA Cheyenne! Such sweet and amazing people who are there to help you. There is no homework besides a short diagnostic paper about a fictional person, two tests, and a final research paper of 5–7 pages. This may sound intimidating, but you get a lot of guidance for it! The professor even brought in her own personal experiences with clients (as she also works as a therapist) into the class which definitely solidified all the concepts that were introduced (especially the CBT special guest she brought in)."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course. The information taught was fascinating and professor Chung is great. The reading was hard to keep up with but not super necessary for class/exams (except for the few random, specific questions regarding info from the book). The midterm wasn’t difficult and professor chung took time to outline what you’d expect to see. The papers were more difficult (perhaps just because I’m bad at writing papers) but we’re very interesting to work on. Overall a very good class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you're interested in becoming a clinical psychologist or therapist, I would highly recommend taking this course. It definitely is not an easy A, so I would not suggest taking it simply for a distro, but it's certainly worth it for information about the career. Professor Chung has so much experience in the field that she shares in the class, which provides a lot of depth to course information. You're graded on a case study paper, a midterm exam, a final exam, and a final research paper. Exams are fair, but incorporate lots of specific information from the textbook and lectures, so they require thorough studying. Papers are also manageable and graded fairly, as long as you give yourself enough time to research and outline. Overall, this class has been really helpful in informing future career choices and I think it's a great course if you're interested in the topic!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course omgggg!! Take it! Prof Chung is so sweet and funny and the content is so engaging. It's not hard to get a good grade, as long as you put in that work"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class! Especially if you are considering grad school for psych. Prof Chung is an awesome person to come to with career questions. There were definitely a lot of readings though, pretty hard to keep up with all of them"
,,,,,,,,,,,"A great course and pretty interesting content, especially if you’re interested in psych as a field/potential career"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class if you're passionate about psych! Alissa is so sweet and super knowledgeable. I feel like I learned a lot. It is not super difficult if you study and do the readings, just make sure to keep up."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is super interesting! Classes are engaging and have a good combination of definitions with anecdotes and video examples. The tests however, were rather difficult and confusing. I feel as though I mastered the information but was confused with the wording of the multiple choice questions especially. Disappointing to not see my knowledge of course material reflected in my exam grades."
wnbg,psych,308,spring,Alissa Chung,5.93,5.64,5.43,5.36,5.79,3.53,"Professor Chung is amazing! If you took PSYCH 306 with Prof. Chung, you will want to take this class. It's a very similar format in terms of how the content is broken down, except there are 2 discussion posts to be made for each class, one case study paper, one group presentation, and one final paper (a longer one which is 10–12 pages this time). You don't need PSYCH 303 for this class, but it can be helpful for some of the topics being discussed! With no exams, this class allows your interest to free flow and just take in all the fascinating facts that are being portrayed. Please take this class!!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Super interesting class! Prof. Chung is clearly incredibly knowledgeable and experienced as a clinician, and always has interesting insights about real clients she's had which helps keep the material relevant and applicable to real life. Not too much work– a case study paper, group presentation, and a final research paper, plus discussion posts for the first half of class. Overall a good choice for psych majors/minors!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class! Professor Chung is absolutely incredible. She not only very obviously cares about her students and is super great both in class and in office hours, but she works as a therapist and is a wealth of knowledge and great resource for those hoping to go into the field. This class taught both about CBT and its extensions, recognizing both its strengths and weaknesses, so it felt like a very well–rounded course. There were discussion posts for each class, but these were questions about the reading and honestly added to my experience (as a person who normally dislikes discussion posts). Other than that, we had a case study paper, a group presentation, and a lit review or research proposal for the final. Honestly, it was all very manageable. All in all, I cannot recommend this class enough, especially for those hoping to work in therapy."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Amazing class, one of my favorites I've taken. Super manageable workwise and classes are always interesting and interactive."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I feel that I not only learn so much about cbt, but also grow so much as a person after taking this course. I appreciate how Professor Chung talk about so many cases and examples in class – they really help me understand how those techniques apply in real life situations, and make me think about the many nuances of therapy. I never liked discussion board and stuff, but the discussion board in this class serves its purpose well and never feel like a waste of time. The readings Prof Chung assigned are always thought–provoking and sometimes a bit controversial so there are always things to ask about, and I enjoy reading my classmates’ answers as well. I really appreciate how Prof Chung spends time after each class answering our questions or discussing them in class – she never leaves questions unanswered, and very few professors do that. The two paper assignments and the group presentation are honestly interesting and a bit challenging at the same time. We get a lot of freedom in choosing our own topics and we get a taste of first becoming a therapist and then a researcher, which is kind of different from other psych classes and a bit challenging at first (similar to 306 though it’s more focused and in depth). I would really recommend going to her OHs when brainstorming about these assignments (or any time!), since she always provides so much expertise and insight as a therapist, and I always end up learning more than my original question. Btw, I really like my classmates from this class. Everyone’s so curious and understanding and the vibe is great. Prof Chung is awesome as always, and after taking several classes with her, this is my personal favorite. Would recommend it to anyone who’s interested in cbt, becoming a therapist, or who enjoyed other classes by Prof Chung!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"great class, professor chung is a practicing therapist herself and based on the class, a damn good one."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this course, especially if you are interested in clinical psychology. Professor Chung is actually just the best and lectures are so interesting. Even the assignments themselves are interesting. No boring tests or papers. One case study and one literature review and you have the freedom to really do what you want!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class! There's a case study paper, a group class presentation, and a final research paper. We went into depth on a lot of therapy methods and topics. I feel like the assignments are interesting and engaging in the sense that it requires you to practice skills that would be helpful in pursuing a career in psychology. Professor Chung is also very understanding and always willing to answer questions in her office hours."
wnbg,psych,310,spring,Mesmin Destin,5.73,5.30,5.43,5.22,5.71,5.09,This is a great class with lots of learning opportunities. My only complaint is that the midterm paper was graded pretty harshly with expectations not being super clear and attendance being penalized even from illness.
,,,,,,,,,,,Readings were long
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was good and bad. I loved our class discussions, finding them really engaging and interesting. However, I don't totally know what I learned. Moving towards the midterm and final, I was struggling to think of the course concepts because nothing had been clearly defined since we mostly only had class discussions. It's not a bad course, but you definitely need to go and engage in order to get anything out of it and be best–prepared for the assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a good class. The first half of the quarter is predetermined topics, and the second half is topics based on student interest. One written midterm, one final paper, a group project (not too bad), and discussion and clarification questions. You have to do the readings and ask a clarifying question and a discussion question for each class. Slides/lecture is minimal, and the class is very discussion based."
,,,,,,,,,,,"100% would recommend this class! I'm a psych student and this was my first SESP class, and I really enjoyed the collaborative nature of this class. Professor Destin is very knowledgable, approachable, and passionate about the course content. The workload is pretty manageable (reading/questions due for every class, a take–home midterm assignment of 3 essay questions, a video group project, and a 8–10 page final paper) and course material is interesting. Highly recommend this course!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is wonderful! It was very interactive in terms of having lots of small group and class discussions, guest speakers, and lectures that were based on questions that we posed about the readings. The readings themselves were interesting and pretty reasonable in terms of workload. Prof. Destin was also super friendly and approachable. Overall, would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is super interesting! There is a 5 PM deadline for questions on the readings, which can get a little tricky in the 2–day turnaround between classes, but there are a lot of opportunities for extra credit. Professor Mesmin and our TAs, Edward and David were SO awesome and led really engaging classes and discussions."
,,,,,,,,,,,"One of the best classes I've ever taken at Northwestern! Professor Destin is such a kind person. He is very approachable and knowledgeable in his studies. He structured the class well, in terms of combining lecture with discussions and combining practice with theory. David and Edward were also amazing TAs who are so invested in the well–being and learning of the students. The class consists of weekly readings and responses (pretty short), a take–home midterm (which we had a week to write), a presentation on an issue of your choice, and a final paper (that typically is an extension on the presentation). I learned so much from this class, not just about identity and motivation, but also about myself and about my academic and vocational interests. I highly recommend this class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class, great prof, great TAs!"
,,,,,,,,,,,This is an awesome course. Professor Destin always wants to take student opinions into account and there are lots of extra credit opportunities!
,,,,,,,,,,,I left every class feeling like I had a new understanding and something new to think about. Would highly recommend this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is discussion based so you should really do the readings. Pay attention to the readings in the first half of the class because they will be used over and over again in the midterm, team project, and final paper."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really liked this course— it applies psychology concepts in way that is super relevant to the real world and addresses social problems like racism, sexism, ableism, health problems, and more. Workload is not that heavy and exams and projects are graded difficultly but fairly."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I like how the professor guides the class to meaningful discussions. I have been in (sadly) other SESP classes where the professor tried to facilitate conversations, but those conversations just weren't happening. I honestly think other professors might benefit from listening to/watching our professor teach! LOVE the class, it covers a lot of topics on race, ethnicity, and SES disparities. The readings are well chosen."
,,,,,,,,,,,LOTS of reading in this class but overall fun if you love a good discussion. Some writing to do but assignments were mixed between essays/discussion questions/projects. You will have to submit the discussion questions the night before class which is a little inconvenient but you get used to it and it shouldn't prevent you from taking the class since it's still really interesting and fun.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Highly recommend this course. Especially if you are interested in education, you will learn so much about institutions and how they are set up to support/not support low income students. There is one take home midterm and a 10 page paper final, but the TAs are really kind and helpful. There is also a project around week 8."
,,,,,,,,,,,"If you want to learn how to best apply psychology to your everyday life, then this course is for you. It's kind of like social psychology on crack with how much you learn and how it relates to various fields of interest (i.e. education, relationships, mental and physical health) If you want to get the most out of it, participate frequently and share your thoughts and ideas: the professor is a great listener but also encourages you to think deeply and challenge yourself in the space. Prof. Destin also makes the class very personalized, where the whole second half of the quarter is dedicated to learning about topics which the class chooses. For example, this year we focused on education, disability status, racial identity, and mental health as student–chosen topics. The space is generally very open and welcoming, so it's a great place to lean in and challenge yourself to participate."
wnbg,psych,314,winter,Daniel Mroczek,5.27,5.27,5.55,4.64,5.27,3.00,"Possibly one of my favorite classes I've taken at Northwestern. The content is extremely interesting, and the curriculum was organized well throughout the quarter, so we were always learning new material while still leaving time for discussion. Grading is very different from other psych courses I've taken –– 2 quizzes and 2 papers (8–10 pages each), worth 25 points each, determine your grade. Grade cutoffs are higher than for most courses (96 is an A). Grading is very generous, and average scores are high, but the lack of wiggle room is a bit scary. Prof. Mroczek wants students to do well, though, and is very open to communicating outside of class time, especially for papers."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I took this for my Psych major and enjoyed it. Learned a lot about aging and different theories and factors. The slides are packed with a lot of information but the overall ideas are easy to understand and Prof Mroczek is so nice and caring. 2 quizzes (midterms in material) and 2 personal papers so doing well in the class is very achievable if you study and write good papers. Glad I took it, very different from my other classes"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Highly recommend! the class is very fun and interesting if you are interested in the topic, it's a pretty specific topic. Dr M is very knowledgable and passionate about the topic, and he cares about the students. Workload very very reasonable. 2 quizzes, each 5 short answer non–cumulative; 2 papers, semi–research paper but the funniest so far in my life"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty lenient grading. Professor Mroczek wants the best for his students. His lectures are very engaging and he always encourages questions. There are 2 papers (8–10 pgs) and 2 quizzes/exams. There is a lot of material and though it can be challenging, Mroczek breaks everything down and is always happy to answer questions in class or over email. Only complaint is that sometimes the professor gets off topic and falls behind so the readings get pushed back, making things more stressful towards the end of the quarter"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I love Professor Mroczek! He is such a kind soul. Every class was like a coffee chat with him. He would go on and on about some crazy story about himself or his friends, and he is super super approachable. The entire class was just out of 100 points, 2 papers, and 2 short exams that were super straight forward and easy to study for. No readings were tested (only his lectures) and he went over each one of them and highlighted the relevant information each time. He is super knowledgeable and doing leading research in the aging and adult development field."
,,,,,,,,,,,TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Mroczek is so charismatic and engaging during his lectures. You can tell he has a deep passion for what he teaches. There are only two quizzes (totally doable as long as you focus in class and study a bit beforehand) and two 8–10 page papers which allowed for a lot of creativity and really cemented what we learned in class. The content is also incredibly important. You'll leave feeling like you learned a lot without all the unnecessary stress and assessments.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked this class a lot. Not too hard, low pressure, v interesting, a good mix of discussion–y and lecture–y, powerpoints are posted, two not so bad quizzes, readings not too bad, plus Prof Mroczek is tremendous. two long essays about your life and an old person's life but they're actually fun to write."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class!!! Professor Mroczek is great! He's one of the most understanding and kind professors at Northwestern, and he's also a fairly engaging lecturer. The class material is interesting, and there isn't too much work involved (the class consists of 2 quizzes and two 10–12 page papers)."
wnbg,psych,317,winter,Benjamin Gorvine,5.92,5.79,5.86,5.50,5.71,4.43,"I love this class! This is definitely more of a seminar class than a lecture — which works wonderfully for the course content. There are two take home exams (answer two essay questions), one group final paper (and a group presentation with this). Prof Gorvine wants everyone to succeed — as long as you are engaged with course material and turn everything in, you should get an A"
,,,,,,,,,,,This course was very insightful and really opened my eyes to the realities of one of the biggest tragedies in history. I walked away with tons of new perspectives and Professor Gorvine is incredibly understanding regarding the workload and managing deadlines. I highly recommend this class to anyone as it is one of my favorite psychology courses I have taken at NU.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is one of the most interesting courses I have taken at this school. Although he subject matter is emotionally challenging, it is such an insightful and impactful course and is truly so interesting. I would recommend taking this course. Gorvine is a great professor!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Discussion posts pretty much every week. Take home midterm papers and a final project and paper. Most of the work is just reading. Very interesting and easy to stay engaged. Love this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a really interesting Psych course and I recommend it to anyone (even non Psych majors). There is a lot of interesting class discussion and while there are a number of assignments they are easy to do well on. Weekly disc posts, paper, 2 take home exams and a project."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Amazing class!!! Professor Gorvine is the best, and this class was absolutely fascinating. Loved every part of this class, and I highly highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"It feels a bit weird to say how great of a class this was, given the tragic topic, but it really was a fantastic class. Each class took a different aspect of psychology and applied it to the Holocaust, from discussions focused on victims, perpetrators and bystanders to the psychology of Holocaust denial and survivor mental health treatment. Even though the content could be extremely difficult at times, the discussions were always impactful and important. Professor Gorvine is an amazing professor and always more than willing to help out. Grades are based on a variety of assignments, including take–home essay exams, reaction papers, and discussion questions, all of which are very fairly graded. Would highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think Professor Gorvine is the perfect person to be teaching this course. He is extremely open and considerate of everyone's contribution to class discussion – he is highly understanding of everyone's needs to succeed in the course. Although at first the workload seems like a lot, it is very manageable because Prof. Gorvine will reiterate key points of the readings during lecture if you need help grasping them. Moreover, it is EXTREMELY manageable if you just do the readings (pretty self–explanatory). The class format is very different/more interesting from other classes because we watch a lot of interesting documentaries tying into class material (my favorite was Denial) and even went to the Block Museum for a class trip which was a wonderful experience. I would highly recommend this course for any Psychology major or anyone pursuing the HEFNU certificate."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was an amazing course, and I highly recommend taking it! Professor Gorvine is such a kind and understanding professor and really cares about the topics and his students. The course load isn’t too much work, and I really enjoyed how discussion based this class was. Take this class!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think I learned a lot in this class. The discussions were insightful and made me reflect a lot about the Holocaust in new ways. Professor Gorvine is very nice and knowledgeable as well, and he does a really good job at facilitating a good environment for discussion by guiding the class and being encouraging of all opinions. However, the class is a lot, and I wouldn't advise taking it if you don't think you'll be able to handle the workload. Between the discussion questions, the incredibly dense and long readings, the group paper/presentation, the reaction paper, and the two essay–based exams, I burnt out halfway through the quarter and never felt like I recovered."
wnbg,psych,324,fall,Satoru Suzuki,4.15,3.98,4.21,4.78,4.27,4.38,This course is very disorganized. We jumped around a lot and got side tracked by students' questions. There are recordings to class but they are audio recordings only. There are 2 multiple choice take home midterm exams and 1 final presentation. It is not difficult to do well in this class but you have to keep up with each lecture.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The Professor was very knowledgable on the subject. However, this class is very dependent on knowledge of neuroscience, and if you do not have a background in that, you may find the material and tests difficult, as I did. Definitely not an easy A, currently trying to ensure I keep a B after spending upwards of 12 hours taking each take home test. If you do like neuroscience, the professor is a very knowledgable individual who is also a good person."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I was looking forward to this course, but the setup of the course was not my favorite. I found it hard to learn."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is an easy A if you can network. All midterm and final questions are posted ahead of time after each lecture so if you can study with a bunch of people, it can be very helpful and informative. But if you are in this fight alone god bless your soul. Additionally since you have questions ahead of time they are quite difficult and I had to watch lectures two or three times to feel confident, but then again it really ingrains the material. You can work for the A, if you have a busy quarter this class isn't for you. Also the professor is literally brilliant like he is so insanely smart and knowledgable. This makes lectures super rewarding if you can decipher them but he is too smart to lecture and goes fast."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course doesn't require a lot of work outside of class as there are no readings and the only material assessed is from the lecture. All exam questions are also given to you ahead of time so you know exactly what will be on the exams, although they are difficult. TAs help if you attend office hours. Exams also are all open book and you have about 4 days to complete it, so you can really take all the time you need. As a class though, I would not recommend it. The material was EXTREMELY DENSE so it was hard to understand without prior knowledge of perception. The professor also isn't the easiest to understand, as he often contradicts himself. But if you really need this class to fill the requirement, take it. But if not, avoid it."
,,,,,,,,,,,Very easy psych class. Not required to attend lecture due to recordings being posted. 2 exams and 1 presentation.
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof gives questions for each lecture directly after lecture and then uses those questions as the exam questions so if you stay on top of the questions each lecture this class is so easy and still offers a very insightful view at how we process the world around us in our minds.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a class that focuses almost entirely on the systems involved with processing visual information. Professor Suzuki structured the class this term based on what he felt students would be most interested in learning each week, and created a lesson plan that flowed logically from one day to the next, as opposed to having a plan set in stone starting before the quarter began. It is a teaching structure that works really well for self–motivated students with a vested interest in and prior knowledge of the subject matter, and who really want to dive in—but given that this is a Row 1 class for the psychology major, I am sure that is not the case for everyone. My main advice for students looking to take this class is to take it AFTER having taken Cognitive Psychology—you will need the background from that class to succeed in Perception. Professor Suzuki has a tendency to use key terminology in his lectures before he defines them, so having seen some of these terms at least a couple of times from Cognitive Psychology will be immensely helpful. Some other information: the tests are open–book (notes, recorded class lectures, Google, you name it), and you have unlimited time to complete them. However, none of the answers are cut–and–dry regurgitation of information, so you need to actually UNDERSTAND the material to do well on the tests. You can't just look up the answers to the questions because a lot are about hypothetical alien species, using knowledge based on how human evolution caused our visual systems to exist as they do today. There is no required textbook or reading, but there is a PDF of a textbook and a very helpful literature review posted on the Canvas page that are still worth checking out if you are interested. I wasn't really prepared to take this class, but I still enjoyed my time in it. Professor Suzuki has an amazing dry sense of humor that made me look forward to coming in to class, even if I may have struggled. TL;DR, you 100% take this class if you are really, REALLY interested in vision and visual perception, and are self–motivated enough to do well in a course with an ambiguous structure. It's genuinely really fun and I'm glad I spent my time here—I just wish i knew what I was getting into before I signed up, so I could have properly prepared and been able to enjoy this course to the fullest."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class was very boring but it wasn't a lot of work so if you can push through the classes this class is not bad. The tests are take–home multiple choice but I wouldn't say they are easy. Not too bad of a class but it is a drag but this counts as a natural science and psych class so I would say do it.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The topics we cover in this course are very interesting, but Professor Suzuki’s a little disorganized and hard to follow in lectures because he goes off on tangents too much and doesn’t explain things clearly. It would be better if the course had more structure to it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall an interesting Psych 300 class but not an easy A. Midterm (30%), Final (35%), Narrated PowerPoint (35%). Exams are take home and multiple choice and have no time limit. But they are by no means easy. Can end up taking a lot of time, especially if you missed a lecture and have to go back and listen to audio recording (he posts audio recordings of lectures on Canvas). Some questions designed to trick you. He posts the exam questions after each lecture, so I would highly recommend doing them right after class while you can easily remember the info without having to scan through all of your notes and lecture recordings to figure them out. I, however, was not wise enough to do this and experienced severe suffering in completing the exams the day before they were due (would not recommend). Overall an interesting class though. Prof Suzuki is very open to students questions and is clearly very passionate about the subject . Also, you need a 95% for an A, which makes it even harder to get one. 🙁"
,,,,,,,,,,,"It meanders a bit here and there depending on the l interests of the class which I appreciated, but it’s not everyone’s style. It was nice to receive the questions to the tests beforehand to check understanding. The unit on color vision was particularly interesting"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, it was an interesting course but definitely a challenging one for a distribution requirement."
,,,,,,,,,,,The prof was very friendly and we had engaging lectures
,,,,,,,,,,,The structure of this course was really nice with two exams and a video project. I also really appreciated the online options if you couldn't make it to class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class makes the topic of perception engaging, even when the lectures are about relatively drive neuroscience and psychphysics concepts. Does a very good job introducing students to principles in neuroscience and in scientific questioning as well as being a great survey of current research in perception. The class has no homework and is not time–consuming overall. However, the lectures can be demanding and the take–home exams require thought and effort."
,,,,,,,,,,,"While a lot of content, I was pleasantly surprised with this course. Prof. Suzuki makes the lectures engaging and while they can be fast, all of them are posted online. It's easy to fall behind in this course because there are no assignments but the midterm, final, and project––> can make for a lot of time in the end to complete those assignments but they are all take–home which is nice."
,,,,,,,,,,,This was one of the hardest and worst courses I have taken. The material is so challenging and hard and makes so little sense. The course is so disorganized in a way its just pure discussion as lecture that becomes the test and the test questions are so dense. I would not go through the trouble to take the course for any credit. I spent 4+ days trying to do the open book midterm and finals but all to no help. It's so hard.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The lectures were disorganized and incredibly confusing. I can't say I learned much in this class. There's a midterm, final, and presentation on ""what you learned"" in the course. The tests were open note which was really helpful, and we had multiple days to complete it. Show up to lecture! It won't be fun but at least you'll be less confused. Semi easy distro since there weren't too many assignments and there wasn't homework, but overall don't recommend it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I went into this course thinking it would focus on top–down processing and how it creates a unique perception in every individual. While that was a topic of discussion, we focused mostly on the neuropsychological aspects of vision. It mirrored a lot of the content we learned in Neuro 201 and 202, which was unexpected. Despite that, the content was still super interesting and I liked learning it. The teaching style was a little bit chaotic and we would go off on tangents a lot during class. The slides were also so cluttered that I found it hard to concentrate."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The slides were almost completely useless by themselves, so you had to attend class and take detailed notes on what the professor was saying. The recordings were just audio recordings so if I missed a day then even listening I missed a lot of crucial information since a lot of the content was visual. However, with detailed note–taking, the information was quite interesting. The exams seemed unfair in how similar some answer choices and questions were and how they were phrased to be purposefully confusing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall I really enjoyed this class. Professor Suzuki’s teaching style is definitely a bit different from that of other professors, but he is really passionate and knowledgeable about the material that he shares about. Professor Suzuki kept the scope rather contained and focused more on depth/examining multiple perspectives, which I really appreciated. This way, we were able to delve into very fascinating and detailed perception concepts that I feel we would typically not be able to cover in classes with a greater emphasis on breadth. The two exams were both take–home, and discussion boards were available for people to ask questions or clarify concepts. There was also a final project that centered around our key takeaways from the class. I feel that this class provided a good balance between individual engagement and group lectures, providing a great introduction to perception."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked it. Honestly, I went to every lecture and didn't always pay attention but Professor Suzuki is really straightforward and sweet and wants everyone to like perception as much as you can tell he does. I personally did not (I wouldn't have taken this except as a major requirement) but I would say I learned something for sure and was interested most classes. The class is two take home midterms, you get all weekend to work on them, you can use lecture recordings, and he gives you the questions that he will ask from each class every day after class so if you're on top of it the test shouldn't take too long. Or you can dedicate two weekends of the quarter to the class and never go. I think you'd be missing out cause Prof Suzuki is really nice and tried to tailor the class to what we are interested in (and sometimes the recordings are hard to follow because he goes on tangents and his slides are confusing if you don't see him pointing at them in class) but up to you."
,,,,,,,,,,,Honestly would not recommend this class. I needed it for the psych major for column B but I'm sure there are better options. Suzuki is super nice and knowledgable but the lectures were super all over the place and could be very hard to follow. It's not a ton of work but just insanely boring in my opinion.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Don't take this class. It's a mess from top to bottom. Prof. Suzuki is clearly knowledgeable but a horrible communicator of the material. The tests are so poorly structured and do not encourage anyone to engage in deeper learning and the lectures are an even harsher indictment of this point. They were genuinely hard to sit through. Once again, AVOID."
,,,,,,,,,,,Very fascinating material and passionate professor. I especially liked the more physics–related explanations of mechanisms such as the generation of action potentials. The only thing I would say is that it would've been helpful to have the slides and voice recordings synch up.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Suzuki is clearly very passionate and excited about teaching the course and factors student feedback into the structure of the course itself. One major drawback of the course, however, is the lecture style. It is very fast–paced and freeform, and the lecture slides had little–to–no writing on them to highlight the main points. It was thus very difficult to tell what we needed to know while in lecture, leading me to almost completely rely on the recordings during the tests since my notes ended up not reflecting the practice questions at all. Again, Professor Suzuki is clearly passionate about us succeeding and enjoying the class, I just think that the lecture style isn't super conducive to that."
,,,,,,,,,,,The exams (one midterm and one final) were difficult to understand but they were take home so we were able to reference audio recordings and lecture slides provided by the professor. The other component of our grade was a recorded presentation which wasn't too difficult.
,,,,,,,,,,,Super easy psych major/minor requirement. Two exams and an easy final project. Suzuki rambles for most of class and runs out of time almost every class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The material is quite difficult, but Prof Suzuki and the TAs really want you to succeed and learn. He’s super nice and willing to help you understand concepts just make sure you are keeping up and using your resources. Don’t wait until right before the test, make sure you understand the questions and concepts as they come"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Suzuki is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the subject, but the slides and content organization of the class is kinda messy. I feel like the ideas he talked about are super interesting but they can be conveyed in a better and clearer way"
,,,,,,,,,,,Pretty confusing class but definitely a very interesting topic. Prof suzuki will give you all of the exam questions after each lecture for a take home midterm and final but evem woth the questions beforehand both exams were quite difficult. Lectures didnt have much structure so that students are free to guide the conversation of lecture but that made it kinda hard to keep track of what we needed to understand
,,,,,,,,,,,"The professor is very nice. However, in the first lecture, he told us that one could probably find better lectures on the same topics online, and that the benefit of having class in person was for engagement. Despite that, the most he really did to engage student interaction and participation in class is ask if we had any questions and ask maybe one question every 2 or 3 lectures. I craved more discussion or hands on engagement, though I guess that's a lecture class for you. The exams are open book but they are really really hard and you have to basically comb through the lecture audio and slides to find the answer. He does give you a full like... four days with no time limit to do them though, so it's doable, just certainly not fun."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Would NOT recommend taking this class as a distro. Having only taken AP Psych in high school, I was able to register for this class but quickly realized it wasn't for me. Content is extremely technical and high–level, and the teacher makes no effort to accommodate considering the majority of students aren't studying psychology. The tests are take–home, and he posts the questions that will be on it after each lecture. They're still really hard."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a unique class. It is all built around Professor Suzuki rambling over some clunky looking slides and then tailoring his lectures to be built around class questions. Then, after each lecture, he creates bespoke test questions and posts them to canvas. Those test questions are the same ones which will be on your take home midterms and finals. The grading for this class was split into three chunks – Midterm, Final, and a final presentation. All in all a pretty easy A where you end up learning more than expected."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was an interesting course. There is no reading and the slides are very chaotic. You have to listen closely to everything the professor says and try to keep up as his test questions are based on very specific things he mentions in lecture. He makes the questions for the midterm/final after each lecture and posts them to canvas so you can have them before the exams which is helpful—be sure to note your answers as the quarter progresses because it’s easy to forget what exactly he said in lecture. While you have this advantage, the questions are still very difficult and performance on these exams is eh. You’re graded only on the midterm, the final, and a final project where you make a recorded presentation (that only the professor will see) about what you’ve learned in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class was super interesting and the professor was very enthusiastic about the class. The only grades from the class are two exams and a final project, so everything counts. However, you do get the exam questions beforehand and it is open book. That being said, the exams are still pretty difficult and not really questions you can search up online."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I thought the material was interesting an I appreciated the variety of material that was covered. However, the lecture slides made the material difficult to follow and did not always stress the most important concepts."
,,,,,,,,,,,"While the structure of this class should have made it incredibly easy (no assignments, open book midterm and final with recorded lectures), I still struggled. I think the lectures were extremely difficult to follow and understand. Also, it does not help that the lectures are the only resource and there are no texts to help make the information more understandable. Overall, don't take this class if science–related topics don't come really naturally to you, because the lectures aren't enough to make you understand and succeed."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was great as a minor requirement, but don't take it as an elective. The format is easy in theory, seemingly guaranteeing an easy A, but the take home multiple choice tests are harder than they sound. You cannot just rewatch the lectures while taking it and expect to get 100%, it's all about application. That being said, though, the format is nice, not demanding, and the lack of readings is awesome. You learn a lot while not being overloaded, so you actually enjoy it. Super awesome class!"
wnbg,psych,328,winter,Ken Paller,4.22,3.92,4.71,5.02,4.09,6.59,"As someone who didn't have any prior neuroscience background, this class was challenging. Being able to take the quizzes from home made it a lot more manageable, but lectures dragged on even though the information was very interesting it just was a lot to process in 1 hour and 20 minute class periods. I felt like nothing really processed, I was just trying to fit all of the information in my notes."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really great and interesting class! Also a great natural science distro even if you’re not pursuing psych or related major. I had almost no background in neuroscience coming in so I expected to struggle, but it was not bad at all. Prof. Paller seems like a very nice guy and is very easy to listen to. No midterms and class is made up of 50% final, 25% small assignments, and 25% quizzes. The final and all quizzes are short answer and closed book. I was initially worried about the final and quizzes being such a big chunk of the grade but Prof gave us plenty of practice questions to help us prepare and they were not too challenging at all."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not bad for a psych major column B requirement, but more work than the intro 200–level psych classes. 4 assignments throughout the quarter that aren't too time consuming and graded pretty leniently. Weekly quizzes that he switched to take home and you pretty much get questions ahead of time (not huge part of grade). Final exam has a lot of material and is 50% of grade, but not too much working leading up to it during quarter"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This wasn't my favorite course. The lectures moved quickly and the slides were confusing. I ended up doing the alternative paper for the final exam, and I learned more from researching the topic of consciousness than I did the whole quarter. I'll begin with the materials and the way the course is taught. It is lecture–based with slides, a weekly quiz, biweekly writing assignments, and a 50% final. Firstly, the slides were absolutely horrendous and not helpful at all. They contain out of place phrases and pictures and unless you rewatch the lecture on Panopto, they are impossible to understand, especially if you don't have a thorough background in psychology or neuroscience. It really seems like the creator just threw random things onto a slide and decided to present it, and honestly that is the running theme for this course: disorganization. There are weekly assigned textbook readings, but they are 60–70 pages of dense textbook readings each class (so around 100 pages each week on top of lecture material), which is impossible to complete. If you add–on having to rewatch each of the lectures because the instruction is awful, and you're looking at easily 15 hours of work a week outside of class, which is horrible. Next, the weekly quizzes are not fun. They force you to keep up with the material, but there is just so much that it is hard to know what to focus on. He gives you study questions each week to prepare for the quizzes, and usually the quiz questions were similar if not directly like the study questions (the only saving grace in this class), but sometimes they would include off–topic questions which were impossible to answer thoroughly unless you took meticulous notes on everything he said. The biweekly writing assignments were easy and kind of a waste of time, I assume the TAs just gave everyone 100% regardless of effort. But really the root of all the 'evil' in this course comes from the fact that there is a 50% final exam written. No class I have ever taken, nor will ever take, has ever had a 50% written final. This course seems to be building towards having a written final with the way you complete writing assignments and learn multiple experiments, but in the end it is just a written final – a huge waste of time and effort, especially since this one exam essentially determines your grade no matter how well you do on the quizzes or the assignments. Professor Paller was a so–so lecturer, you could tell he was knowledgeable about the material, but oftentimes it just seems that he was rambling, or reading of the slides (which are terrible by the way), which made each class seem so disorganized and have no organized flow of information or ideas. Overall, I implore you to not take this course. Other CTECs may say it's an easy A, but if you are a hardworking student, this will not be an easy A, in fact it will be a very hard A. I had an extensive background in neuroscience and psychology prior to this course (since I was a senior) and even though this course went over some basic concepts of those fields, they were presented so confusingly, that even I had trouble following along with information that I already knew (and which was taught much better in other classes). As a Group A, this course was not fun, please do not take it, I am trying to warn you like I wish someone else warned me – DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Please, find another Group A (I know they are all very bad except psych 110), you will not regret it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"First of all, do not take this course. I cannot emphasize this enough, this was unequivocally the WORST course I have ever taken at Northwestern – I would rather retake Orgo than sit through this course again. Please do not pay attention to the previous years CTECs as the course has changed radically."
,,,,,,,,,,,Really informative course but if you have no neuro experience the first 5 weeks are going to be hard. Paller taught and was a very nice man but pretty disorganized in terms of lecture content. Weekly quizzes instead of midterm were nice but may make it feel harder to prep for the final.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very good course, you learn a lot about the brain and all the different ways it can break. Prof. Paller's lectures are very interesting. Not too much work, so would recommend for a distro!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"TERRIBLE LECTURES AND SLIDES. I almost never write negative CTECs, and I love psych and this content, and I go to every lecture, so this review isn’t bc of malice, disinterest, or lack of engagement. But Prof. Paller’s lectures and slides were the most incomprehensible I have ever experienced. Prof. Paller, if you’re reading this: PLEASE contact Prof. Franconeri (who is a Powerpoint expert in terms of creating clear, easy–to–understand lectures because he studies visual perception/communication) and send him one of your powerpoints or just Google “how to make clear powerpoint.” There is WAY too much text, and WAY too many different text sizes, text faces, colors, and misalignments. Emphasis on the way too much text – it’s impossible to read, follow, and understand it all (and the black background doesn’t help). Importantly, the lectures also jump around a TON – even if it seems like it makes sense to you, they feel incredibly disorganized because there’s no clear conceptual framework. It’s often just a bunch of studies and concepts interwoven together, back and forth. I got the big picture when I was studying for the final, but in the moment it was really hard to. This is also because lots of erroneous details are included (eg. going highly in–depth into study methods that are not necessary to understand the main idea (eg. Korsakoff’s IQ measures)); it may seem like the details make the picture fuller for us, but they are just confusing. More focus on the big ideas and less on the details would be great. ALSO the assignment instructions were very vague – more specificity would be great. The good thing is that Prof. Paller gave us a list of study questions before the final that were very similar to the questions on the final, so it was much easier to study and focus on the big ideas (and the exam was, accordingly, pretty straightforward). Also you don’t need to do the readings to do well on the final!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was really interesting but also difficult. You can just not attend class and then watch the recordings back on panopto so you can rewind, bc in person it goes fast and is not always clear the first time around."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Paller is a great lecturer but goes fast. I really liked this class though. It's like a window into neurology.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not an easy class, even for someone with a background in cognitive science and some neuro. Prof. Paller is not a clear lecturer, so it's a lot of self–teaching. That said, I found the content very interesting – so if you don't mind doing a lot of your own work teaching yourself the material, the actual quizzes and assignments aren't terrible."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Paller is so nice and knows a lot about neuroscience, but his lectures were oftentimes difficult for me to understand. Overall it was manageable, but I felt like I had to put in more work to understand concepts outside of the lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,The class only has one final that is heavily wegihted. The class has a lot of course material and I think it will be very difficult to remember all of the information learned in this quarter. The professor was well spoken and it was clear he enjoyed the topic
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is probably the most difficult class I have taken so far, and I would recommend taking cog sci or cog psych before taking this class. There was a lot of content so you have to make sure to keep up with the readings and the lectures. The class was interesting but it was a lot of work with the readings, quizzes, and assignments."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is unnecessarily hard. Professor Pallers lectures are SO HARD to follow and review and it's so so much material. Final is 50% of the grade and weekly quizzes can get pretty specific and nit picky. You have to spend a lot of time in this class if you want an A. I don't recommend, especially if you don't have any background in neuro."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I think there is a way to make this class much more engaging. Lectures are very neuroscience and brain pathway specific and less focused on disorders. Weekly quizzes, 4 assignments and then the final is worth 50% of your grade. You also go through A LOT of material and lectures can be hard to focus the whole time because of this. Secondly, I believe that more interactive and collaborative activities would enhance the learning experience. As it is, the course relies heavily on individual readings and testing. If looking to fulfill column two requirements for psych, I suggest a different course. While grading may be easier, there is a lot of work if you fully engage in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Would not recommend. Unless you have a background in neuroscience, the course is very hard to understand and very confusing. Just so much information to take in and not super relevant and useful. Professor's lectures are long, dense, and hard to follow."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall this was an interesting course and I definitely learned a lot about cognitive neuroscience. The lectures are kind of difficult to follow sometimes and slides are not super helpful. I would suggest reviewing the material often and making sure to study/do the practice questions for quizzes. The class is pretty stressful but manageable, with a quiz every week, some assignments and a final worth 50%. The final was worth so much of our grade which was stressful, and it took a ton of time to really study for it. I suggest focusing on the study questions which were very similar to the questions on the final. At the end of the course, we were given the option to write an essay instead of the exam. It would have been nice to have the options given at the beginning of the course. Students were also encouraged not to take the essay option as it would be graded harder, which was good to know but also felt a little unfair that we were given an option that was not really an option. I was happy I picked the exam as the questions were straightforward and most were from or similar to the study guide. Overall this is an interesting class but definitely requires a lot of studying and pretty stressful at times."
,,,,,,,,,,,"As a person with a psych background, this course was VERY neuroscience heavy. You need a pretty solid grasp on small neuro details and there is a lot of information that he tells you during lectures."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not a difficult class, but also not one that is as interesting as I thought it would be. The lectures were often dry and the slides were all over the place. Weekly quizzes were kind of annoying because you would study 2–4 lectures just to answer two short answer questions whose answers sometimes were not overly discussed during the actual lecture. Assignments were not bad and actually a little fun to do and think about. The final, which is all short answer seems daunting at first, but the study questions they provide cover the majority of the things you need to know."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course requires a lot of memorization and work on your own just internalizing the class content. In class might be a bit monotonous and Professor Paller's slides may confuse you beyond belief. Just take notes to the best of your ability and refer heavily to the Panopto recordings to listen to his explanations over and over again. Always do all of the study questions as well as the final exam guide study questions. Put in honest effort in and outside of class (not just through attendance) and you will do well.
,,,,,,,,,,,This was a great class and Professor Paller is a great teacher and is passionate about this class. There are weekly quizzes every Tuesday which can be hard to keep up with but the professor gives guidance on what will come up as well as being able to drop your two lowest scores. I really enjoyed this class and learnt a lot.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The content of this course is very interesting, but the lectures can be hard to follow at times, and I have found myself needing to go back and watch the video recordings to better understand what is being said. The weekly quizzes are straightforward as long as you keep up with the quiz questions that Prof. Paller posts each week. However, I found the instructions for the assignments to be confusing sometimes and needed to ask the TA for clarification."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was one of the hardest, yet most interesting courses I've taken at Northwestern. Unfortunately, it's jam packed with a lot of information that can become overwhelming. Professor Paller packs a ton of information into the lectures and moves quickly. The class itself is relatively manageable. The weekly quizzes essentially help you create a study guide for the final, and the assignments were fun. The exam was nice because we were able to select a few questions we did not want to answer, but the exam is worth 50% of the grade, and there's a lot of information to learn. Additionally, while neuroscience is not a pre–requisite for this course, it really should be and having some background in it will better prepare you for success in this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a good course, but the course content can be difficult to grasp if you don't study! Lots of textbook reading."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Lowkey don't take this class – it was a lot more confusing than I expected – Prof. Paller is very nice but his lectures often make little sense, and the weight placed on the exam makes this class dangerous for your GPA."
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof paller is a dry lecturer. Would recommend avoiding taking a class w him if you can. There’s easier column b classes than this
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was overall a great class. The material was interesting and the lectures were enjoyable if you're interested in the content. The slide decks weren't very helpful if you didn't see the lecture, so going to class is pretty important. I learned a lot of cool stuff and Professor Paller was great."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a very good –– albeit at times fairly challenging –– class. Professor Paller is a really wonderful guy, not to mention a good professor. He takes time to answer questions thoroughly and thoughtfully, and although his lectures themselves can sometimes be a little hard to digest, doing the readings before (as opposed to after) coming to class makes things a lot more comprehensible. The weekly quizzes and occasional assignments make the class fairly low–key for most of the quarter –– just make sure to stay on track and start preparing for the final a couple of weeks out! Overall, I would recommend this class to anybody who has ant interest in psych/neuro/cog sci whatsoever!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The course is really interesting and you will cover many interesting syndromes and neuropsychological mechanisms. Paller isn't the best lecturer but certainly not bad (I did not think he was as poor as previous CTECs made him out to be). Overall, a very interesting course. However, there is a lot of material. The homeworks aren't bad at all if you put effort into them. Though the final, recorded presentation was a bit daunting. The final exam is during finals week and is my chief concern considering the sheer amount of content covered about the brain."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This wasn't my favorite psych course. I would caution that it is pretty neuro–heavy, so if you don't have that background you may find the first few weeks difficult. At times it was hard to figure out what I was supposed to be getting from the lectures. Prof Paller clearly cares a lot about his students and I appreciated the study questions and essay option for the final."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Don't take this class for psych column B requirement. I took it because the past CTECS were decent, but Paller made this class hard this quarter. There were 4 assignments, some individual and one partner. Quizzes were hard and study questions were semi–helpful. They replaced the midterm, which meant that the final was 50% of your final grade! Absurd. This shouldn't be allowed. Had to study around 60 short essay questions. 23 were given on the exam day, allowed to skip 5."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course felt very organized, but I think the content is interesting. I don't really agree with the grading distribution though. We did 2 short papers, 1 ""debate"" partner paper, a 5–8 minute research video (25%), 8 quizzes with 2 lowest dropped (25%), and a final exam or essay (50%). For the amount of work put into the other assignments, I didn't think it made sense for a 2 hour final exam or a single essay to be worth 50% of the grade. Otherwise, this course has really interesting content especially if you enjoy interdisciplinary classes that bring in ideas from psych, neuro, and cog sci."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The only reason this course was given a lower rating was the prof. I has paller and the other prof is significantly easier and an easy A. Oh my gosh I completely forgot that psych students can take this class too. DO NOT TAKE IF UR PSYCH. Im neuro and half the stuff was learned if this class were taught in my NEURO 202 and 206 class, so I have no clue how psych students would even understand the material. Even if ur neuro, take with Garbowecky, you will get an easy A."
wnbg,psych,330,winter,Mark Beema,4.50,4.49,4.77,4.74,4.44,5.01,"this was just a bad class. I am a psych major and extremely interested in this topic but it was just taught badly. professor beeman's slides are terrible and hard to engage with, they are disorganized, and I felt as if the exams did not reflect what was highlighted in the lectures. If you take this class, take it with someone else –– it is too cool of a concept to lose interest in like I did"
,,,,,,,,,,,If you participate in this course you will learn a lot. I would not recommend trying to follow along to the recordings. The professor can be a little difficult to follow and sometimes I felt like I was lacking important context for the course—but the exams and quizzes were all totally fair and based on the important concepts stressed during lecture. Would recommend this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The content isn't super easy, but it is extremely interesting and if you keep up with the lectures and study them you should perform well. Quizzes and homework are fairly easy, but the midterms are really what could kick you if you're falling behind."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a course where you learn a lot and its not too much work at all. No readings, just weekly quizzes and HWs + Midterm and final exams. Prof Beeman is a solid lecturer and clearly is interested in the subject. Easy A– for sure."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class makes you work for it. 2 exams that are all short answer, 8 quizzes with 2 dropped, 4 homeworks with 1 dropped. Very doable if you actually try. My main issue was that the professor made me feel stupid every time I asked a question."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The content of the class was interesting, but the structure was a bit confusing and disorganized, and the grading felt really arbitrary."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Lectures were fast–paced but very interactive, so I felt very engaged in class. The workload was very manageable; between short weekly quizzes, weekly homework, and the two exams, I felt like I remained active in the course without it being overwhelming. It was also great that there wasn't really any reading/memorizing textbook information, just watching and attending lectures. Graded assignments focused more on applying broad concepts/themes and methods to different situations, which was more meaningful than memorizing lots of small details."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was easy, but the powerpoints were honestly confusing and didn't help when studying. However the class was easy and the exams were super intuitive. If you pay attention in class you can get an A in the class"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Do not take this class. While the material was pretty easy to understand and definitely interesting, the class was extremely disorganzied. The slides asked so many questions without saying the answers, and reasons were ALWAYS worded differently so true answers were really unclear. Grading was also extremely subjective on assignments and exams. I got points off for backing my answers with examples and being specific, but my friend got points off for giving general answers that were too vague. I left the first exam feeling confident and did really poorly for this reason, even though I knew all the correct answers anyway. I felt really let down by this class, and I was initially excited for it. This was probably my least favorite class at Northwestern so far."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a pretty easy course if you pay attention during lectures. Make sure you pay attention though because sometimes homeworks and tests can be a little tricky if you don’t. Overall, this is a good class to take if you need it for a Psych requirement and if you’re especially interested in this subject, it’s a great class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a really interesting class! I was excited going into the class because of my major (neuroscience) and I have an interest in this career. While the class material was not exactly what I thought (since it's a topics in neuroscience class), and it was rather more psychology–and–linguistics–focused than neuro–focused, I think I still enjoyed learning about the broadness of brain and language psych. The class is mostly uperclassmen, so as a freshman who begged Prof Beeman to get a permission number, it was sometimes hard to collaborate with others on homework and studying because I didn't have many friends: so make friends in the class!! There are a mini–quiz and homework each week. They're not that hard but are good ways to prepare for the two exams, which are not the hardest but the grading was a little harsh. Overall, the class quizzes, exams, and homework were not the worst. However, Prof Beeman's slides can sometimes be really disorganized, and if you miss a lecture and look at the slides he posts after class, they will be really confusing because his slides are based on his lectures, so you would need to rewatch the recorded lectures. Nonetheless, Prof Beeman is very knowledgeable in his field and very encouraging, so build good connections with him!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really liked Professor Beeman and how he presented the course content through individual, true case studies and then we explored what had happened to the individual to learn about brain damage. This course was comprehensive, challenging, and relevant, and it certainly made me more interested to learn about the effects of brain damage. He split the course into 2 halves with 2 midterms (no finals) which made it less stressful, and he even conducted some fun experiments on the class. My biggest struggle was that the exams were really hard to finish and required a lot of writing in only 50 minutes, so I am unsure about how well it measures to my performance and knowledge. We did not have any class readings, only homework and weekly Canvas quizzes, which is an interesting but effective take for a college course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Beeman is a very good and knowledgeable lecturer. The class started a little slow, but quickly became interesting is now one of my favorite psychology classes at Northwestern. There are weekly online short quizzes and homeworks that are not too difficult. Overall, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in psychology or cognitive science."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Beeman really wants to have an interactive discussion and let the students discover ideas for themselves, which is a good instinct. However, not many students participated in our class and there was a lot of time wasted waiting for someone to speak up. There were also four–or–five–point quizzes every week that were quite tricky at times and could tank your grade if you got a question or two wrong. This, combined with the exams which had about forty points each, leaves no room for error. This is especially frustrating when the exam questions are short response and phrased in a confusing or subjective way."
,,,,,,,,,,,Not a bad class but the powerpoints are extremely unhelpful. You need to pay attention to the professor more than the slides. The exams are also such a time–crunch that it is hard to finish on time.
,,,,,,,,,,,Not very difficult concepts but you still need to apply yourself to get good grades. Good overview of brain's language systems and language acquisition.
,,,,,,,,,,,"As someone with not much experience in neuro and psych it was really cool to see how the brain actually works. The homework assignments, quizzes, and assignments are not too difficult either, although there are so few points in this class being accurate and reviewing the material is pretty important, even if you do get some dropped."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Good course. Not easy, but interesting"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was much more interesting and informative than I had been expecting! The workload was honestly very chill –– one homework assignment and one short take–home quiz per week, two non–cumulative midterms, no final. Although the homeworks were sometimes graded a bit harshly, there were some extra credit opportunities, and the tests were very doable. I'm personally not the most interested in neuroscience, and the topics that we covered regarding language wasn't exactly what I was expecting (mostly neuroimaging techniques, hemisphere dominance in language, aphasias, etc.). That being said, I enjoyed this class, and it was manageable even while I was taking bio and orgo at the same time. The professor was very nice and enthusiastic about the course material as well, and I loved the little experiments sprinkled throughout the course!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked the course structure, I found it fun we talked about ChatGPT in class which was very relevant"
wnbg,psych,333,spring,Lance Rips,5.17,4.67,4.29,5.14,5.17,6.43,"This was a great class. We had a weekly reading (those were around 15–30 pages including references), so those were pretty dense and took awhile to read. The readings came with weekly response assignments (4 questions about the content of the reading). These assingments weren't technically graded, but in order to get above a 70 percent in the course you had to complete them all. The final project was 90% of your grade, where you conducted and wrote up an experiment furthering one of the research topics we read in class. I feel like the expectations for this paper could have been a bit clearer with maybe an explicit rubric, but overall it was a good experience. Professor Rips is great!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Sort of a weird class, but interesting. Basically just read a research paper and then discuss different theories in class and most of your grade is an open ended research paper. Not a lot of work and at times seems kind of aimless, but intellectually challenging/interesting. It challenged me to think in a way none of my other NU classes have."
,,,,,,,,,,,Covered some pretty interesting topics in class that I enjoyed.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was super interesting but was pretty challenging. The readings were fairly complex and difficult to understand, but the class discussions helped clarify any confusion. I just wish that the homework assignments were graded throughout the quarter. We didn't receive any grades back so that was difficult."
,,,,,,,,,,,The readings for this class are ridiculously thick and dry. The way assignments are set up is such that your final grade is 10% participation and 90% a research paper on a project you design yourself but are given extremely little guidance on. There are also weekly readings and assignments that are graded only on completion and if you don't do even one of them or turn them in late you get an automatic C in the class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The only assignments that are graded are the final presentation and the final paper, so you won't know your grade until well after reading week which isn't great. Prof. Rips seems very flexible for how those assignments can be approached which is great, but it's hard to know what's expected due to a lack of super defined grading criteria."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is great if you are looking for a class that is more philosophical. Professor Rips is a great teacher who is at the forefront of the research in this field, making the course very exciting. The class consists of weekly discussion questions, with only one of them being graded if you choose. The rest of the course is decided by a paper, which accounts for 70–90% of your grade."
wnbg,psych,336,spring,Satoru Suzuki,4.47,3.92,3.65,4.00,4.42,3.32,This class was amazing. Very low time commitment but is an absolutely amazing professor. I loved learning about this topic as much or as little as I wanted. There were no tests just weekly discussions and a final paper. Totally suggest taking this class.
,,,,,,,,,,,Interesting topic but very unique class structure (in both good and bad ways). I would say only take it if you’re strongly interested in the topic
,,,,,,,,,,,Love Suzuki and am very interested in the topic but it was definitely more theory than I expected. Grading is interesting but fair (kind of) — would have liked more individual feedback from the prof or TA and not from classmates. Would’ve helped me learn more
,,,,,,,,,,,Good class. I don’t think i went to class after week 2. only assignments are weekly discussion posts and replies.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was pretty weird. All of the work was just a weekly discussion post (most of which were just ""what is the most interesting thing you learned this week?"") and a final essay with a very vague and open prompt. The class had a weird structure where a lot of the lectures were student–led presentations or discussions. Also, your final grade in the class is partially based on a peer evaluation where we were forced to rank three random papers as best, middle, and worst. The content is interesting but I did not like the way this class was formatted. I would have preferred more structure and papers graded on their actual quality, not how they compare to others in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,Super chill class. Attendance not mandatory and assignments not too challenging. Was hard to get super into it I feel like it could benefit from a seminar–like format instead of discussion based.
,,,,,,,,,,,I enjoyed reading different excerpts from textbooks and articles that broadened my understanding of consciousness.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Had high expectations going into the class. Professor clearly is passionate about material, but lectures are hard to follow and the final paper grading structure is frustrating (only one third of the papers can be ""good"", another third ""average"", and the rest ""below average"", with peer grading where we grade three papers but have to assign each paper to a different category)"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Overall, I thought this course was interesting, but I sometimes felt that the course did not have enough structure, and lectures on the more theoretical concepts were sometimes confusing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"For a Row B/300 level requirement for Psych it's okay. Throughout the entire quarter the workload is pretty light and you honestly do not attend class to do the weekly assignment (although in the future they should probably require attendance). It is not until the final paper assignment that is the most time consuming. As interesting as the material was for this class and how fond I was for volunteering to present on a topic to get 2 weeks off of the weekly assignment, I was not the biggest fan of the grading policy used for the final assignment. Basically, 50% of the grade consists of the professor distributing As, A–s, and Bs to thirds of the class. The other 50% is your classmates ranking 3 papers (including yours) 1 (weakest) to 3 (strongest), no ties. I found it extremely unfair in the cases of if a friend group just ranked their friends a 3 or if one objectively has 3 of the best papers in the class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would say this course is extremely interesting regardless of your academic background. Professor Suzuki is super accommodating and even opened up 25 more seats in the class after it had filled during pre–reg. Suzuki always stressed that coming to class was optional because he wanted students to only come if they wanted to engage in the material and that all the readings provided were not mandatory. Although this is not an approach used in most classes, I do believe that it was beneficial because I never felt that I was stressed out and I was able to engage/do readings that were most interesting to me. As for the class structure, there is 1 400–800 word essay due each week followed by a 300 word peer review each weekend. The only other assignment is the final which is a 2 page single spaced essay where you get to pick the prompt. The prompts are super fun and the final can only boost your grade not decrease it. Overall, I appreciated the course structure and material!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a very interesting class, and it is fairly simple to do well because most things are graded on completion."
,,,,,,,,,,,overall structure of the course was a bit confusing
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a prime example of a course where you get out what you put it into it. You really do not have to attend class nor complete the readings in order to get a decent grade. If you simply do the weekly essays, which are not bad at all, you are guaranteed a B+ in the class. Your final grade fully depends on the final paper. Those who scored in the upper third percentile get As, middle percentile get A–s, and lower third percentile keep a B+."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Attendance and readings weren't mandatory, which is nice if you're looking for an easy class. On the other hand it's easy to slack and just not learn anything. Professor Suzuki is so great though, very open–minded and will answer any question."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was very interesting but I found the grading for the final paper to be a bit unfair. I don't think the peer grading system is a good idea, but otherwise the rest of the class is fine."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof Suzuki is a pretty laid back professor. Every week you will have a 400 word discussion post due on Friday. and will have to submit one 300 word peer response by that Sunday. Much of the class is just discussing our own ideas around consciousness. I'm not sure how much material I actually retained. The final paper is graded in a very strange way with three peers randomly grading your essay against two other random papers. You have to assign the three papers you review 1 (weakest), 2 (middle), and 3 (strongest) which is kind of tough if you get put with two other great papers. Besides the grading of the final paper this class is chill."
,,,,,,,,,,,"don't take this class. everything is just so confusing – materials, lectures, assignments...Definitely an easy class but not easy A"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is deceivingly easy for almost the entire duration. The vast majority of the course is graded based on participation. However, the final paper was graded on a competitive basis, where the bottom quarter students or so finish with a B+ (assuming they completed all of the participation), about half finish with an A–, and the top quarter or so finish with an A. The instructions for the final paper were a bit vague, I think intentionally so, to allow students to take the topic in whatever direction they chose. However, I was penalized for taking a more abstract approach to the final paper, rather than explicitly mentioning one of the theories covered in the readings. If the TA's and prof were looking for that, it could have been specified in the instructions."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was easy in that you didn't have to really show up, and just had two weekly assignments. However, the concepts were extremely difficult to understand, lectures were unclear, and I basically had to scramble every week to find something to talk about in my discussion post. The class covers interesting topics, but a lot of them are super high–level and I definitely felt out of my element."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I'm really torn about this class because on one hand the content we covered is possibly the most interesting stuff I've ever learned, but the way the class was graded is a little inexcusable in my mind. I'm sure some other CTECH has gone into detail about how it worked, but the up and down of it is that the grade depended entirely on the final paper, and the grades were distributed 1/3 as As, 1/3 A–s, and 1/3 B+s. Any grading system in which not everyone can get an A even if they deserve it is wrong in my opinion. At the same time, I had to stay in the class because the content really is that interesting. Prof Suzuki isn't an inspired lecturer, in fact my favourite classes were when the students presented on some of the topics. Regardless, the discussions of the functions of consciousness, some of the theories of consciousness, the flow state, free will, appreciation of art, out of body experiences and the question of whether or not consciousness persists after death were some of the most interesting I've ever heard because that's how interesting this topic is."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Not too difficult of a course. Just a weekly discussion post and comment under someone else's post. Both are basically graded for completion, so if you do all your weekly work, you are guaranteed with a B+. The final paper determines whether you get a B+, A–, or A. I've noticed it's pretty easy to get an A–, but you gotta have a good essay for an A. Overall though the class is pretty low stress, not too much work, and the professor is really nice."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Chill class. Professor Suzuki is very intellectually stimulating but also at times hard to follow. But he is also very willing to answer questions and gets very excited when students participate, so it's not that big of a problem. I would highly recommend if you are into the topic."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is definitely challenging. Very neuroscience heavy. I often felt confused, reviewing content many times and going to lots of other resources to understand. But such is the nature of studying consciousness. Luckily grades are based on weekly 'essays' (400 word response) and weekly peer reviews of another student's essay. Lastly, there is a highly theoretical final essay incorporating all the concepts we've learned this quarter. Prof Suzuki is really nice about grading these papers."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class consists of weekly discussion posts, an optional presentation, and a final paper, but the final grade depends almost entirely on the final paper. The readings and lectures can be dense and confusing. Overall, the workload is manageable, but the content was quite difficult for me to understand."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Came in with high expectations but it's honestly not a great class. The good thing was that the workload was low – only one discussion post + peer comment each week – but the grading format for the final paper was kinda messed up. The course is designed so that the final paper determines your grade: A third of the class will get an A, another third an A–, and the rest a B+. Although not too difficult to get an A–, you definitely need to write a final paper much better than your peers to get an A. It felt like the professor didn't want everyone to get an A by doing this, which is not something I want to see from a psych class."
wnbg,psych,339,fall,Renee Engeln,5.95,5.75,5.68,5.58,5.89,6.57,"Ok I absolutely love and adore Prof Engeln and everything about this class except the exams. The class is broken up really well, the readings for the most part are digestible and Prof Engeln is just like one of the best lecturers to ever exist. Not only is she super engaging but like all of the data she pulls in is also as recent as possible so you're getting a picture of these dynamics that are pretty close to present day which is super cool. It isn't super necessary to have readings done for the purposes of like being in class, but you'll have to do them eventually (or skim or like ctrl+f) for the exams because a good number of questions on the exam come directly from the readings. All 3 exams were take–home exams for us which was nice in that you didn't really have to study, but honestly sometimes it was hard to tell exactly what Prof Engeln was looking for in our answers which made it difficult. And the exams themselves are just soooo long, honestly each probably took almost 10 hours to complete because you go hunting for a bunch of information and then have to try and communicate it fully while being limited on how much you can write. I wouldn't necessarily say they're difficult like content–wise, it's just hard to figure out what you should say and where to find it. The worst part of the class was easily the finals: we were assigned an op–ed to write, due the day before the final exam, and having both to do simultaneously REALLY sucked. Reading week kind of sucked for me cuz all my Bienen performance assessments were during that so I didn't have the bandwidth to really get started on any of my finals for Weinberg classes, so this combo took up a lot of time. It was really hard to get started on the op–ed because like I've never written an op–ed and like where to start??? I just flat out had no idea what I was doing honestly so I struggled a lot with it. Ask for help and go to office hours if you can because Prof Engeln will definitely help if she can. The final exam was... a doozy. She said it'd be shorter than the other exams and it was like point–value wise but there were a couple more questions on this exam and like having less points means we have to write less sentences so in a way made it a little harder because we were more limited on what we could say. It was just so much to manage in addition to my other finals, would've loved a situation where like she made either the op–ed or final optional or something like that, I don't know, just something to take a little bit of the load off."
,,,,,,,,,,,Very interesting class. All classes with Renee are always fun.
,,,,,,,,,,,Readings weren't hard and lectures were very informative
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class is amazing! Renee is one of the best psych profs at NU, and if you can manage to take a class with her, do it!! Highly recommend. Work was manageable, but I felt like I learned a lot. Always looked forward to going to class!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Renee is amazing as usual, classwork wasn't too difficult to complete – 3 take–home exams, in–class activities, and an op–ed paper. Lectures were engaging and the topic is super interesting, definitely left the class knowing way more about gender issues in modern society."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The coursework for this class mostly included doing readings before class and then completing the take–home tests and a short paper. This class is easy to do well in as long as you get everything done, and of course Renee is an awesome professor who is very helpful and understanding. I recommend this class as an interesting elective, and it helped me think about gendered issues in a more well–rounded way."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Renee is the best and is an awesome professor. This class was interesting, but the material was a little hard for me to fully comprehend. There were three take home exams that took me a good amount of time outside of class, but you have a week to complete them so you have time to spend on them. Renee is so nice and understanding which makes this class great."
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS. Renee is one of the best professors at Northwestern, and this course is fascinating. The exams are hard to do well on but the class is so worth it."
,,,,,,,,,,,Renee is an amazing instructor and I would recommend any class with her
,,,,,,,,,,,"amazing class!!! renee is such a gem, she makes class so interesting! great discussions and it's easy to do well as long as you go to class, pay attention, and take good notes. the material itself is engaging anyway, but renee makes it even better."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class, if you are able to get in definitely take it! Didn't really need to do the readings as long as you are focused in class. Learned a lot and it was very interesting!"
,,,,,,,,,,,Material is pretty interesting and is really brought to life by Renee. Overall I learned a lot of new things and the class time was enjoyable. Definitely recommend!
,,,,,,,,,,,Amazing class with Renee just like all her classes. It's definitely very focused on where there are/aren't gender differences rather than gender more broadly but I always left class wishing it was longer because Renee is so fun to talk to and learn from. Show up to class and take good notes and it's easy to do well on the take home exams.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is a must–take for psych majors but also for anyone in gender and sexuality studies, too. The content in this course is super important for people to know and understand. As far as logistics, there were 3 take–home exams and a final op–ed writing project. The tests are easy as long as you do the readings and pay attention in the lecture (they are recorded, too)."
wnbg,psych,340,fall,Sara Broaders,5.63,5.63,5.74,5.53,5.68,8.69,"I highly recommend taking this course! It is very reading intensive, but every assigned article/piece is fascinating. Anyone remotely interested in psychology and/or legal issues would find their niche in this class. Discussions were insightful and several of the documentaries we watched will stick with me for the foreseeable future."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a super interesting class. 40% of the grade is discussion posts, 20% is textbook quizzes, 15% is participation, and 25% is for the final project. The discussion posts are a little difficult at first because it's hard to know what she was looking for, but once you get the hang of it, they're pretty easy. I would also recommend not doing them last–minute so you have time to actually form an argument. The quizzes are open–note online quizzes where you get 3 tries, so those were super easy as well and I've gotten 100% on every one. The final project was either a 10–12 page paper or a 15–20 minute presentation that you could do in–person or with an online recording. I was frustrated that we needed 8–10 outside sources that we didn't read for class for the final project since we did so many readings for class. Right now, my grade before the final and participation grade have been added in is about a 97%. I learned a lot in this class and I found it really engaging. It was kind of tiring that most of the class was just discussion/debate, but it was a good way to practice speaking up more in class and arguing my opinion. However, I think a lot of the readings were pretty dense and hard to get through. They took up a lot of time if you wanted to read them thoroughly instead of just skimming."
,,,,,,,,,,,This course helps you see the positive and negative aspects of both psychology and law. There may be a good amount of weekly readings but the chapter quizzes and discussion posts are fair.
,,,,,,,,,,,This was one of the most interesting Psych classes I've taken here and would highly recommend it to anyone who is even a little interested in Law. The class was mostly readings (6–8 readings per week) but with it being a once a week class that was mostly discussion/watching documentaries it felt very manageable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class and was so happy to finally get into it. It's a deep dive into the intersections between Psych and Law so the readings will be long (textbook chapter(s) and several articles a week) but they're overall very exciting. You're asked to write weekly discussion posts in response to the readings (250–300 words, you might find that you'll probably write more by accident.) Professor Broaders will grade the responses with a careful eye with the goal of teaching you to think critically and write clearly, so don't rush them and expect do well. You're also responsible for textbook quizzes on Canvas. These are open book and you can take them up to 3 times _ super manageable. I spent about 5–6 hours a week on homework. It depends on the topic and your note–taking preferences. The readings are SO eye–opening, the conversations in class are juicy and thought–provoking, and the documentaries are emotional and insightful. The final project is either a 10 page paper or 15–20 minute presentation on a topic of your choice. I highly recommend this class if you love psych, criminal law, or both."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class if you can! Especially with professor Broaders. She is an absolutely wonderful lady and really guides the discussions to make you think about the topics in new perspectives. The class is discussion based but extremely chill and as someone who struggles to speak in class, this class and Broaders just made it very welcoming and easy to get a word in. Each week there are a couple of readings then you summarize the readings into a 1 page (max). Classes involved fun exercises, many a documentary and snacks. Final assignment is either an 10 pager or 15/20 min presentation on any legal psych topic of choosing. The final project has a little less structure but she is more than welcome to help out with that. Overall, learned a lot and would highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Fascinating class on the complicated relationship between psychology and the justice system. Readings were pretty heavy but manageable and you have to do them since the class is very discussion based. Most of your homework will consist of the readings, followed by weekly discussion posts and open note reading quizzes that you can retake. Prof Broaders is great and provided a lot of fun and interesting activities that supplemented the topics covered in the readings. The final project will require a bit of time but is pretty fun as you can discuss any psychological/legal topic that you find interesting."
,,,,,,,,,,,Awesome class – really eye opening and challenges a lot of misconceptions the public has about the law and uses psychology and science to back it up.
,,,,,,,,,,,"A lot of reading, but the topics are interesting"
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Broaders does well to make a 3 hour class fly by. The workload is manageable and discussion questions should not be taken lightly as they make up most of your grade for the class.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is so so good and is really important to take for anyone interested in psych and/or law. This course provides a ton of content that has great implications in the real world and is super valuable. That being said, this course is not easy. There is quite a bit of reading weekly but the reading is very interesting so it doesn't always feel like a lot. There are weekly discussion questions and quizzes on the textbook chapters."
,,,,,,,,,,,"LOVED this class. Weekly discussion questions that were basically one–page responses to the readings, no midterm, and a final research paper or presentation. Reading is hefty and Broaders can be a tough grader, but the content is so interesting that it didn't feel like a burden. Genuinely looked forward to going to class every week to discuss / debate the topics."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was really enlightening, but be warned, there are some components that are a bit disturbing! It's important, though, to realize that psychology and the law mix a lot, and that it occurs most often when pathopsychology is involved. You learn about solitary confinement, battered woman syndrome, and more, and Dr. Broaders does a great job teaching it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I have learned so much in the class. Each class is 3 hours long but it passes by so fast. It's basically all discussion, with some documentaries sprinkled in. Not going to lie I always left class depressed because the things we talk about kind of suck the life out of you. But overall, Dr. Broaders is a great professor for discussion and encourages a lot of speaking & debating during class. Amazing class!!!!!!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Very interesting class. Lots of reading, but everything is super interesting. The class is long, but it goes by super fast. Cannot recommend enough"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was amazing!! The workload can be tough, many readings and discussion posts but trust me its soooo worth it. I learned so much in this class its not even a joke. Prof. Broaders is great, caring and supportive to her students. She is really good at keeping conversations going, the 3 hour classes go by so quickly and I always looked forward to them! Be prepared because some of these topics are heavy and depressing at times but very eye opening and good to be aware of. I totally recommend this class hands down"
wnbg,psych,341,fall,Wendi Gardne,5.75,5.45,5.45,4.74,5.65,4.00,"Valuable, fairly easy class. The readings could get lengthy at times but definitely read them thoroughly, especially the ones before the midterm. The midterm was a bit challenging and required knowing a lot unnecessarily specific details from the readings so definitely study and memorize the readings/authors. I do find it a bit ironic that the prof preaches about well–being but then requires students to do weekly discussion posts, papers, and daily interventions (which would take up way too much time if you actually did them all), but it is what it is."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was my favorite class I've ever taking at Northwestern. Prof Gardner is simply like the best, her lectures are so engaging and although the class is 3 hours, it passes by really quickly because the topics are always super interesting and really relevant. 1 midterm (multiple choice, 2 short essays, and 1 longer essay, if I remember correctly), a team project/presentation, 1 final paper, and then discussion posts and quizzes. Everything was fairly easy (and honestly doesn't require you to do all of the reading but doing the reading doesn't take too long and is usually really helpful!) and straightforward, the assessments never stressed me out that much because you'll do just fine by paying attention in class. I cannot recommend this class enough. The interventions were great and I learned a lot that I'll definitely take forward with me! <3 Prof Gardner so much"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class! Wendi is one of the best psych professors I've had and it's so clear that she's passionate about teaching. The material is interesting, and the workload is very manageable. If you have any interest in pos psych and can get into the class, go for it!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is awesome! Professor Gardner is really engaging, super nice, and cares about her students doing well. The content is super interesting and the class isn't demanding. Overall a really great course to take."
,,,,,,,,,,,Pretty chill class. Manageable and very reasonable workload and the stuff you learn in class is actually interesting and useful. No final exam. 10/10 would recommend.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is one of the best classes I've taken at Northwestern! It truly made me think about my own happiness and emotions, and the material was very stimulating. The lectures are long, but with discussion and teamwork it makes it better."
,,,,,,,,,,,This is the only enjoyable three hour class I have taken so far. Lectures were somewhat engaging but the lectures are divided so you get some breaks. Work is not difficult at all and the topics are easy to understand.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course content was amazing. It was great to know to apply to everyday life and was interesting. I wish the final project and paper were a little more spread out, as it felt like a lot at once."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course! Professor Gardner is amazing!! She's very kind and understanding. This class was a lot of fun and my first 3–hour class at Northwestern but the structure of the class (lecture, discussion, break, lecture, activity) helped me stay engaged throughout. I learned a lot and there were a lot of interesting studies we were taught."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class! Engaging presentation of material, manageable assignments and midterm."
,,,,,,,,,,,"LOVED THIS CLASS! Learned so much about the psychology of wellbeing and ways to boost happiness in my own life, gonna remember what I learned forever"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I learned a lot more in this class than I thought I would. The way the class is taught is really well done. It is a lot more work than I expected it to be, though. Other than readings, there is an exam you really have to study for an a couple really long essays. Also a long presentation. A lot of research is done in this class too. Just remember it is a 300 level course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Super great class, definitely learned a lot that I felt was actually applicable to life"
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class. Very interesting content and practical interventions for increasing happiness. The work load isn't too bad at all and Professor Gardner is amazing.
,,,,,,,,,,,Easily one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Northwestern. I learned so much in regards to positive psychology and what I can implement in my own daily routine to increase my well–being. Professor Gardner is a great lecturer who supplements her points with interesting research and provides us with activities to increase our happiness. The readings every week are also very manageable.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Loved the class and Wendi is the sweetest professor ever. Definitely have to keep up with everything to do well, but it’s a really rewarding class overall."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Straight forward, interesting, great professor, not too much work"
,,,,,,,,,,,Incredible class! You learn so much about happiness and well–being. Wendi is just so knowledgable and passionate as well. The weekly happiness interventions are so beneficial for our wellbeing too.
,,,,,,,,,,,"An amazing course and very applicable to daily life, definitely found myself thinking/applying what we learned in class to outside life and changed how I thought about things"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is one of my favorite classes at Northwestern. The one bad thing about the course is that it is 3 hours once a week, but Wendi does a good job structuring the class so it does not feel too long. The midterm was hard but everything else was great. This is a course that you should take for life, and it made me think about things differently"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would recommend taking this class. You learn a lot of useful information that can be used to actually better your life. You're expected to do quite a bit outside of class and there are a lot of readings, but with class once a week it's not too terrible."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Decent class, midterm was not as easy as expected. Very fluffy and won't touch real issues that actually affect happiness for most people (poverty, lack of healthcare, oppression, etc). People in the class were pretty oblivious and ridiculously privileged, but that's common for NU."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great course to take as a senior. You get out of it what you put in. It was really fun to do things outside of class that contributed to your wellbeing. Definitely take this class as it is very enlightening. I feel the final essay is unnecessary and could be substituted for something else, but this should not deter anyone from enrolling in this class."
,,,,,,,,,,,great course!
,,,,,,,,,,,Awesome course. Homework is very reasonable and doesn't take much time. The material is taught well and 3 hour classes are broken up nicely with discussions and breaks.
wnbg,psych,343,winter,Renee Engeln,6.00,6.00,5.88,5.75,6.00,4.00,Loved this class! Highly recommend to anyone who is able to take it!
,,,,,,,,,,,"Did this course help me learn? Yes, because of the professor, her choice of readings, her ability to engage us in a 3 hour lecture, the exam format forcing you to reflect on material in a thoughtful way as opposed to cram memorizing… It’s just an excellent course. Every course taught by Renee is. Look, you probably won’t get into this class. I got lucky because I had 8:30 am pre reg. If you happen to be lucky and are a senior Psych major or minor with super early pre reg like me, take this course and don’t think twice. Even if you don’t need any more psych courses. It’s not even that bad workload wise. The readings are super interesting. Just take the class, it’s the best I’ve taken at NU and most people who took it and aren’t weirdos would agree."
,,,,,,,,,,,This class is amazing. Readings could be a lot sometimes but they were all really interesting. Subject matter is extremely interesting and relevant. Take this.
,,,,,,,,,,,Great class! Professor Engeln makes the class super interesting and the format of the class is not bad at all with 3 exams and a project. I learned a lot and didn't mind it being a long night class.
,,,,,,,,,,,this class lives up to the hype
,,,,,,,,,,,"Best psych class I have taken!! All the readings are genuinely very interesting and Renee is the best! Not necessarily an easy A, but also not hard to do well. If you can get into the class, would definitely recommend."
wnbg,psych,350,winter,Daniel Mroczek,5.27,5.27,5.55,4.64,5.27,3.00,"Possibly one of my favorite classes I've taken at Northwestern. The content is extremely interesting, and the curriculum was organized well throughout the quarter, so we were always learning new material while still leaving time for discussion. Grading is very different from other psych courses I've taken –– 2 quizzes and 2 papers (8–10 pages each), worth 25 points each, determine your grade. Grade cutoffs are higher than for most courses (96 is an A). Grading is very generous, and average scores are high, but the lack of wiggle room is a bit scary. Prof. Mroczek wants students to do well, though, and is very open to communicating outside of class time, especially for papers."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I took this for my Psych major and enjoyed it. Learned a lot about aging and different theories and factors. The slides are packed with a lot of information but the overall ideas are easy to understand and Prof Mroczek is so nice and caring. 2 quizzes (midterms in material) and 2 personal papers so doing well in the class is very achievable if you study and write good papers. Glad I took it, very different from my other classes"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Highly recommend! the class is very fun and interesting if you are interested in the topic, it's a pretty specific topic. Dr M is very knowledgable and passionate about the topic, and he cares about the students. Workload very very reasonable. 2 quizzes, each 5 short answer non–cumulative; 2 papers, semi–research paper but the funniest so far in my life"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Pretty lenient grading. Professor Mroczek wants the best for his students. His lectures are very engaging and he always encourages questions. There are 2 papers (8–10 pgs) and 2 quizzes/exams. There is a lot of material and though it can be challenging, Mroczek breaks everything down and is always happy to answer questions in class or over email. Only complaint is that sometimes the professor gets off topic and falls behind so the readings get pushed back, making things more stressful towards the end of the quarter"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I love Professor Mroczek! He is such a kind soul. Every class was like a coffee chat with him. He would go on and on about some crazy story about himself or his friends, and he is super super approachable. The entire class was just out of 100 points, 2 papers, and 2 short exams that were super straight forward and easy to study for. No readings were tested (only his lectures) and he went over each one of them and highlighted the relevant information each time. He is super knowledgeable and doing leading research in the aging and adult development field."
,,,,,,,,,,,TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Mroczek is so charismatic and engaging during his lectures. You can tell he has a deep passion for what he teaches. There are only two quizzes (totally doable as long as you focus in class and study a bit beforehand) and two 8–10 page papers which allowed for a lot of creativity and really cemented what we learned in class. The content is also incredibly important. You'll leave feeling like you learned a lot without all the unnecessary stress and assessments.
,,,,,,,,,,,"I liked this class a lot. Not too hard, low pressure, v interesting, a good mix of discussion–y and lecture–y, powerpoints are posted, two not so bad quizzes, readings not too bad, plus Prof Mroczek is tremendous. two long essays about your life and an old person's life but they're actually fun to write."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Take this class!!! Professor Mroczek is great! He's one of the most understanding and kind professors at Northwestern, and he's also a fairly engaging lecturer. The class material is interesting, and there isn't too much work involved (the class consists of 2 quizzes and two 10–12 page papers)."
wnbg,psych,350,spring,William Revelle,4.63,4.38,4.63,4.38,4.75,5.00,"You will learn a good amount of R if you do the assignments attentively and make an effort. Not hard to get an A, though the final was quite time consuming."
,,,,,,,,,,,Lectures are confusing but the homeworks are easy and somewhat helped me learn
,,,,,,,,,,,"Revelle is AWESOME, but the class is eh"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Grading is primarily based on weekly assignments graded for completion. The only other assignment is a final research paper. Prof. Revelle is super helpful, you just have to go to office hours or ask him before or after class"
,,,,,,,,,,,"All the assignments and projects were very reasonable and manageable, but I did feel like the course materials (lecture slides, syllabus, etc.) were a little difficult to learn from. I would have liked more step by step instructions on how to do simple things, as opposed to looking at everything with such a high level summary during class"
,,,,,,,,,,,Useful course if you already know some R! Then you learn some new functions/data processing techniques. I think it would have been really overwhelming and way too much work if I hadn't taken R before because the basics were not really explained.
wnbg,psych,351,fall,Harry David Smith,4.78,4.67,4.56,4.78,4.44,4.33,"Let me start by saying Prof. Smith is an incredibly kind and understanding professor, and is always willing to answer questions or meet outside of class time. Super sweet guy. However, the lectures can get pretty dry. I struggled to pay attention, especially when the most advanced stats came into the picture. I did learn the differences between different statistical procedures, how to run them in SPSS, and how they’d best be applied in research, which is helpful. And the details of ANOVA and how to write up results. But a lot of the theory behind how the stats work and the details of the procedures took up most of lecture time, and I didn’t learn much because it was really boring to me (sorry prof. smith!)"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great course, especially for people interested in PHD/research route. Teaches highly relevant content in a digestible and efficient manner, with problem sets and exams that reinforce the lecture materials by being adequately demanding."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class that leaves you with a strong basis for how to design and interpret psych research! Definitely geared more for those with strong statistical background, but the information is presented in a way so that even those with the least amount of mathematical background can succeed. Some of the content may seem overwhelming at first (the 10+ different types of statistical procedures may seem daunting), but Professor Smith does a great job at explaining the details and differences between them. Grading is pretty typical and based on 6 problem sets, a midterm, and a take–home final. Overall, would highly recommend for those interested in furthering their knowledge of statistical methods in psych research."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The content can be a bit difficult, but it’s doable if you stay on top of it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"We learned about the stats behind one–way ANOVA, ANCOVA, factorial design, correlation and linear regression, and logistic regression, as well as how to perform these procedures in SPSS. I feel that I mastered these tests pretty well after this class, but I honestly expected more to be taught since these procedures are pretty standard, and you could learn them by watching youtube videos. I also believe that this course would work better with a TA and more office hours."
wnbg,psych,360,fall,William Revelle,2.80,2.80,2.40,2.60,2.40,3.80,"I think the class itself was engaging in the first few weeks, but as I said above it was a bit hard to follow in the second half. Overall, my biggest gripe with the class was that, while the slides themselves were structured well, the rest of the class was not. There was an initial mid term that had no rubric and it seems like Professor Revelle was maybe just grading them arbitrarily? They were a combo of about 6 free response questions and there was no clear instructions on how long they should be or what he was looking for. On top of that we never actually received grades or feedback for the midterm...ever. It was the same pattern for our research proposal, with barely any instructions, no grades and no feedback. Like I had not received a single grade the entire quarter and I am really worried what my grade is gonna look like next week. I could have an A+ or an F. On top of that his syllabus mentioned there being an optional final exam that could help boost our grade and he just never posted it. Revelle is clearly like enthusiastic about the research and is well known in the field, but the class kind of stressed me out with the way it was organized."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class feels outdated and not up to Northwestern standards. The material feels disorganized and niche, it makes it difficult to study for when it seems like what we learn in class is something only contained and comprehended by the professors. The class was supposed to be seminar style but it was just the professor speaking at students. The material covered during class was more data and computer based than it actually was focused on conducting personality research. The professor can be frustrating to work with especially since student won't be able to know any grades until they are released on Caesar, even though we've had assignments dating back to the first weekend of school starting. There has been no feedback on the midterm or paper which makes it difficult to be able to learn what the professor wants, since we aren't given rubrics or any guidelines of what expects for assignments. I was severely disappointed taking this class as I have had so many great experiences taking upper level courses at Northwestern that were engaging and eye–opening. Please don't take this class, it is a waste of time and an extra headache."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is probably my least favorite class I've taken at Northwestern. I truly did not learn anything and I blame that on completely unengaging and overly confusing lectures. Professor rambles, grades aren't uploaded. A bummer cause I thought I was interested in the material."
wnbg,psych,364,winter,Alissa Chung,5.94,5.69,5.60,5.27,5.81,5.36,"Highly recommend! You can tell that the professor is super passionate about the content. Professor Chung is literally the best, she's so understanding and lectures are very interesting! As long as you pay attention in class and take good notes you'll do great. Highly recommend!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great class. The first half of the quarter was pretty light on work, and then the research proposal snuck up on me. Professor Chung is great and always happy to help her students out. I recommend this class to any psych major who needs the row 2 requirement."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great course, manageable workload, and Professor Chung is the sweetest and a great lecturer."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class, I hope everyone takes this if they have to. Very chill class with the papers being pretty fun and creative to write. You will have a great time in this class. Professor Chung is awesome!"
,,,,,,,,,,,I LOVED THIS COURSE AND PROFESSOR CHUNG. TAKE IT. i learned so much and really enjoyed doing the work for the classes
,,,,,,,,,,,I love Professor Levy Chung and she did a great job of making the class easily digestible. If you've taken developmental psych classes before it's a bit repetitive but still goes more in depth on certain topics. Definitely glad I took this for the upper level research requirement but I wish I took it closer to when I took research methods
,,,,,,,,,,,"The assignments throughout the quarter weren't as bad as I thought they would be. The final project is the big stress. Otherwise, super engaging class and Alissa is so kind. She brought donuts at the end of class."
,,,,,,,,,,,"i really enjoyed the content covered in this course. i feel well versed in social and personality development after this course and it helped me refine my topic of interest for grad school (in psych). prof levy–chung is really helpful outside of class, too"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Prof. Chung was great as always. Super interesting class, can be really relatable, creative assignments, not too much work. Highly recommend."
wnbg,psych,367,winter,Benjamin Gorvine,5.91,5.55,5.45,5.00,5.73,3.73,"This is a great upper level research class! Very manageable workload, just make sure to start on the research proposal early. Professor Gorvine is super nice and approachable. He established a great atmosphere in the class. Highly recommend, especially if you're interested in the clinical side of things."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a great class. Prof. Gorvine is an awesome professor and really tailors the course to what the students are interested in. Besides the readings, there is not a huge assignment load––only two reading responses, one group project, and a final research paper. It is very much a self–directed course––you put in what you want to get out of the class. It also doesn't overlap as much with Psych 303; it goes into much more depth on a few disorders. All in all, a great choice for the 300–level psych major requirement."
,,,,,,,,,,,Take this class! Prof Gorvine is super nice and the workload is very manageable
,,,,,,,,,,,Interesting class taught well
,,,,,,,,,,,"Interesting class. Very similar to Psychopathology, but there's enough difference. Not a lot of readings or work either. Two papers due during the quarter, one group presentation, and one long 13–16 research paper at the end. Research paper can pretty much be about anything and it was pretty interesting"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this class. The workload was manageable: one group led class, two 3–4ish pg responses (he offers multiple submission times you jsut need to pick two), and one big 13–18 pg final research paper. The final paper was a bit daunting, but prof. gorvine sets up a peer review opportunity that forces you to get a headstart. The content was super interesting, and class discussions during lecture were super engaging. Highly reccommend this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Professor Gorvine is the best and is such a kind and responsive professor. He returns grades very quickly! Only 2 case responses which aren't too hard, 1 group project leading and then a final research proposal that is 13–16 pages. The final is definitely the hardest part and it is hard to motivate to get it done unless doing research stuff is your cup of tea. Overall, not a very hard class and any class with Professor Gorvine is guaranteed to be great."
wnbg,psych,372,winter,Dedre Gentner,4.75,4.50,5.25,5.50,4.50,6.00,"This course is not for the faint hearted. If you’re really interested in Dr. Gentner’s work and how language and cognition may be related, then you’re going to love this class; however, if you don’t know what I’m talking about or don’t care about it then this class would probably not be fun"
,,,,,,,,,,,Interesting but very niche content and lots of reading. Professor Gentner is clearly super knowledgeable about the subject but also be prepared for class discussions and pop quizzes.
,,,,,,,,,,,"It seems very overwhelming when you first get in the class but it's really not that bad. The readings can be dense and confusing, but it gets more comprehensible as you go on. The teacher is pretty understanding and wants to help you succeed as much as she can."
,,,,,,,,,,,The content of this course was pretty interesting but it required a lot of reading and the ability to comprehend and remember small details of specific information. Dr. Gentner is brilliant and an expert in the field but is a very harsh grader.
wnbg,psych,373,fall,Harry David Smith,5.63,5.19,5.13,4.88,5.25,3.26,"Professor Smith does a great job teaching about this subject. He is obviously very knowledgeable about it. The content is really interesting, but can get repetitive sometimes. It's a great class to complete a column B psych major requirement. There are just 2 exams and a presentation at the end of the quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was great. The topics we learned about were very interesting as they examine everyday phenomenon on a deeper level. Nothing was overly complex, if anything lectures could be a little repetitive at times, and HDS explains everything thoroughly. The class' assignments consist of a midterm, a group presentation, and the final. While this is great in that you don't have to struggle over weekly tasks, HDS is a little slow to grade with the presentations (grades were not handed back for it by the final), so for much of the class you only have 1/3 assignments to base your standing in the class on. If this could be fixed it would have made the class perfect."
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Smith is the best! He’s extremely caring and accommodating. The material is interesting but lectures can get boring at times. There are two exams throughout the quarter but i wish we had more opportunities to interact with the material on it during class (to help us learn it).
,,,,,,,,,,,Professor Smith is so sweet and you can tell he really cares. The class itself was interesting but lectures could get a little dry. Your grade is only made up of two exams and a group presentation… so don’t fall behind.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was a really interesting and helpful psychology course. I think it did a great job of utilizing information you have already learned in previous psych classes and incorporating it into how we make judgments and how we can improve our decision making capabilities. The workload is very manageable, just two exams and a group project. Professor Smith is also a really wonderful professor who makes the class engaging and enjoyable. He genuinely cares about his students and their learning, and his positivity and enthusiasm was a major reason why the class was such a good experience."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class, super straighforward, you don't need to do a lot of the readings toward the end of the class. Prof Smith is the best and super nice, understanding, helpful, fun. Highly recommend taking this as your column B 300 level."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class, I really enjoyed it. Wasn't exactly what I thought it would be (marketing) but similar to what CTECs said about judgement/heuristics/biases. Overall super interesting, really great examples/studies and HDS is so funny and entertaining in class. Not a ton of work just 2 exams and a final project."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great choice for an upper–level research course for the psych major. The workload is super manageable (especially since all of the readings that are on the exams are also covered in class), and the professor is really kind and wants you to succeed. It isn't always the most interesting course, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs to knock out the requirement and learn a little bit without being too stressed out."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class, HDS is great and really cares about the content. Content is also super relevant to life"
,,,,,,,,,,,"this is a good column b class, i actually ended up enjoying it more than i thought i would. as long as you show up to class and take good notes you'll do reasonably well. the professor is such a nice guy!"
,,,,,,,,,,,I loved this class and I recommend that anyone who can should take this class! It was super interesting and you learn about topics that you can apply to your current life and notice things that you do all the time. Professor Smith started his classes with some review which was so helpful in remembering all the terms and effects and gave me a better and more confident understanding in the things I was learning. He is also so nice and helpful.
wnbg,psych,373,spring,Harry David Smith,5.67,5.67,5.33,4.57,5.56,3.44,"One of the most interesting classes I've taken at Northwestern. The structure of the class isn't difficult, the content is super interesting, and Professor Smith does an amazing job of fostering good discussion."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I loved this course! One of the most interesting classes I have taken at Northwestern. There was not much work outside of 2 exams and a group project, and I am already applying concepts from class to my life. Exams are very fair and you get a review sheet. Would definitely recommend!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"I would highly recommend this class to anyone! Not only is it super interesting and well taught, it's also extremely applicable and can help with decision–making in the future. The class itself is pretty straightforward, weekly readings are the only outside work aside from the final group presentation. The final grade is heavily weighted on the midterm and final. Professor Smith is a wonderful professor, always making lectures interesting and applicable to the real world."
,,,,,,,,,,,The material learned in class is interesting but at times felt repetitive. I feel as though the class would benefit from a refresh of structure to help better group ideas and how concepts are taught. HDS is very passionate about what he teaches and cares about students!
,,,,,,,,,,,amazing. HDS is the goat
,,,,,,,,,,,I enjoyed this class a lot! I learned a lot and did well on the exams without needing to do any of the readings.
wnbg,psych,387,spring,Ginger Pennington,5.00,4.86,4.29,4.14,4.86,3.57,"I'm so glad I got to take this course with Professor Pennington! There were weekly quizzes on Canvas that weren't too hard as long as you referenced the textbook. The professor also provides optional reading guides to help you as you do the textbook readings. 4 other application assignments due throughout the quarter that build on each other and all lead to the final research project. Overall, the consumer psychology concepts were really interesting to apply to the final project."
,,,,,,,,,,,I dont think anyone actually cared about this class. neither the professor nor anyone in the class seemed to make any special effort.
,,,,,,,,,,,"Cool class, get a lot of freedom on assignments to pursue what you are interested in. Weekly quizzes are not timed and open note so not as stressful as they sound. Classes are all lecture based which can be slightly boring at times but also important to learn key concepts."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is super easy and Ginger is such a great prof! However, I really could not tell you many new things I learned. Most of the material was stuff we learned in other psych classes or just obvious stuff about motivation. But, I def recommend taking it if you're interested in marketing. Lectures are not too dry either."
wnbg,psych,390,fall,Sara Broaders,5.71,5.57,5.71,5.29,5.71,5.86,"Professor Broaders is 100% one of the professors you must take a class from if you're looking to improve your writing. This course was so interesting and I looked forward to class discussions. This course discusses real, controversial issues and encourages you to see issues from multiple perspectives."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Just like other Professor Sarah classes, discussion posts every week and she has expectations on how you should write. The content is super interesting, and I really enjoyed watching the documentaries. Discussion based so you have the pressure to talk every class, so maybe consider it if you are not the type that's comfortable speaking. The class content is really interesting though I have to reiterate!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Really interesting class. Improved my psych writing, reading, and discussion abilities a lot."
,,,,,,,,,,,Great course overall. I learned A LOT about psych research. But the readings can sometimes be tedious
,,,,,,,,,,,"TL;DL: Take this class!! This class was exceptional! Arguably my favorite class I’ve ever taken. There is a lot of reading, but 95% of the readings are really fun to read and engaging. I frequently found myself looking up even more information about the topics. Professor Broaders expects a large portion of each class discussion to be student–driven which has pros and cons. On one hand, we had some really exciting and fierce debates about topics, but occasionally the class would get way off–topic discussing small details or fringe hypotheticals. The workload is very manageable! The largest assignment (besides the final) is an annotated bibliography (completed with a partner) on a chosen topic. A lot of people made the bibliography more difficult than it needed to be and gave boring presentations which weren’t fun to sit through. Other groups, though, made their bibliography presentations much more fun (you could easily tell when Professor Broaders was enjoying a presentation and when she thought one was boring). The other large assignment is to be a discussion leader for a class. There’s not much direction given about how to do that so you have a lot of leeway in terms of how difficult you want to make discussion leading. The key is just to facilitate a productive discussion and be prepared with topics/questions for the class related to the readings. A noon before most classes you submit a short discussion question about that week’s reading. Most of the time this is pretty fun to do, it’s just difficult getting it done by noon the day before class sometimes. Broaders is a tough, but fair grader. She looks to make sure you really understood that key points of the readings."
wnbg,psych,390,fall,Galen Bodenhausen,5.50,5.50,5.00,5.00,5.00,6.00,"The course was interesting and relevant, and it was taught in a format that made sense."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I found this class really interesting! There are usually two readings prior to each lecture, which you annotate collectively with the class and are graded on the annotations. You present on research papers twice throughout the quarter, and there is a final research paper."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course is cool if you are interested in psychological sciences and would like to think about concepts from multiple angles. I disliked that readings assigned for homework were not discussed during class time; this made the class a bit confusing at times. Overall, though, the workload is manageable and readings were usually thought–provoking."
,,,,,,,,,,,"The class was pretty straight forward and the workload was consistent throughout the quarter. Some of the readings toward the end of the quarter were pretty long, but it was generally a super manageable workload. Overall a good row 2 class that covers a lot of interesting topics, though each topic is covered quite quickly."
wnbg,psych,391,fall,Mark Beeman,5.00,5.00,5.00,4.20,5.00,5.40,"I think this class was very manageable overall! Every day during class, we discussed a research article that was assigned. Each week, we were responsible for submitting a one–page single–spaced reaction paper (one per week). There was no midterm. The final paper consisted of writing about an experiment we would conduct to test the mind's creativity/cognition (5 pages single–spaced max). As long as you keep up with the research articles, participated in class, and did the reaction papers/final paper, you should be fine!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"It's discussion–based, you read two research papers per week and write a reflection page on them. The work load wasn't too bad, and the topics were v interesting, I just wonder how will this help me get a job one day idk"
wnbg,psych,391,winter,William Horton,5.86,5.43,5.43,4.86,5.86,4.72,"Pretty straightforward seminar class: weekly readings, discussion posts and big research paper at the end. Generally not too hard, just doing readings and talking about them"
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class was so intellectually stimulating. I also loved the snacks it was so fun. I looked forward to this class every week. Also, Sid is the best, sweetest professor ever. Love him."
,,,,,,,,,,,Discussions were always lively and engaging. Not too much work besides keeping up with readings and a final essay.
,,,,,,,,,,,i was surprised i didn't expect to like this course as much as i did
wnbg,psych,391,spring,Mark Beeman,5.09,4.91,4.64,5.55,4.64,4.46,Great class overall! I don't have a neuroscience background but it didn't feel unmanageable. Professor Beeman is super helpful and good at answering students' questions. The articles we read are very interesting.
,,,,,,,,,,,"You should take this course if you KNOW you are interested in Cognitive Neuroscience research. This course is NOT designed for people who are new to cognitive neuroscience. You will be reading a lot of research articles in the field and reviewing them. It takes some background knowledge about the brain to get the most out of this class. The class has a loose, discussion–based structure. If you are into self–teaching and discussing content then this course may be good for you."
,,,,,,,,,,,"There are lots of readings and you will be quizzed on it each week, and throughout the quarter you will have to write 4 discussion papers on it which are around one page double spaced and do one presentation. I originally thought that the workload would be a bit too much but they ended up being manageable, and the professor is amazing. I learned a lot during this class, and I think its pretty easy to get an A if you do all of the assignments, contribute to the discussion, and attend class every day."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was a very straight forward class. We had to do 4 reaction papers (one page single spaced max), had weekly quizzes based on lectures, and had to present one research paper to the class. There is no final exam, so the class officially ends before reading week, which is very convenient."
,,,,,,,,,,,"One of the best classes I've taken at NU, not necessarily easy but it is interesting and not draining. Prof Beeman is also really great."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This is a manageable course in terms of workload. There are no exams; grades are based on assignments and participation. However, the material can be dense and difficult to understand without any neuroscience background."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really liked this course! It was very laid back, and there were no midterm papers or a final paper. The class was graded on online weekly quizzes (just to see if you paid attention), four reaction papers, a presentation, and participation. I did not have to put a lot of time into the class, but talking about research concepts during class time helped me learn a lot. I am a neuroscience major, so this class actually helped me a lot in my other neuroscience class this quarter that I took along with it."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class isn’t bad. You read a paper or two per week, someone presents them in class, then we discuss the papers. It’s pretty easy, but can get old quick. Prof. Beeman is nice, but isn’t the best at explaining novel concepts to people who didn’t have prior knowledge (luckily I did, but I can see that other ppl had trouble understanding). You also have 4 critical reaction papers to do throughout the quarter, which are pretty open ended (and about the readings for that week); he graded them pretty leniently but sometimes I didn’t understand why he gave me x grade for one and y grade for another. Also, I wasn’t super super interested in the content (I’m more of a psych person and this is pretty strictly cognitive neuroscience), so the content of the course wasn’t quite for me. Overall, it’s a pretty laid–back discussion course that you can get an A in if you pay attention and do the work, but you probably won’t learn anything life–changing."
,,,,,,,,,,,"to be so honest, i had no idea what was going on in this class half the time. the discussions are pretty hard to follow if you don't have a good background on different parts of the brain and the papers are soo dense and jargon–y. i'm not really sure why this is categorized as a psych class because it seemed to me more neuroscience but whatever. with that being said, you're still able to do well if you ask questions in class. he doesn't necessarily care that you fully understand the material, more that you're making an effort to piece things together. another thing i really liked was that you get to choose the days that you submit papers and presentations in advance. so i got everything out of the way in the first 4 ish weeks and then was able to kind of skate through for the rest of the quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,"TAKE THIS CLASS!!! The style of teaching –– reading articles for homework then diving into them in class with supplementary info – was so conducive to learning for me. The class was fun, engaging, and I loved being able to just answer the random questions that I had along the way. The seminar style was so interesting. I also have absolutely no neuroscience background (have not even taken 221) and this class was entirely manageable and I never felt lost. I learned so much in such a digestible manner, and I can not recommend this class enough!"
wnbg,psych,392,winter,Greg Miller,5.93,5.50,5.29,5.36,5.79,3.86,"chill class, you get how much you put in. the class format encourages discussion and critical thinking. really like it. Greg is super nice and chill too. He is very knowledgable in the materials and is very willing to engage with students."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I really enjoyed this class. I feel like I learned so much and the discussion was always very interesting. Prof Miller is great and has a lot of insight on the field. A lot of the readings for the class was research he's done, and it was really interesting to get to hear him talk about and explain it. I feel like I learned a lot about psychoneuroimmunology, which is such an interesting field, but just about research in general."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Fantastic course, a lot of the papers you read are by Prof. Miller. He is an expert on the subject and you really learn a lot. The class combines a lot of concepts and you can choose which you want to focus on."
,,,,,,,,,,,"This was such, such a fascinating class. Truly one of my favorite that I've taken for my major –– Professor Miller is an excellent lecturer and explains complicated concepts so well. I really enjoyed the discussion based orientation of the class and the debates at the end. All in all, just so interesting and enjoyable –– would highly, highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Definitely recommend this course! Prof Miller is so nice and really cares about his students and making sure they understand the material. The class is mainly discussion based, you talk through the readings, so super chill. Grades are based on participation (20%), a class debate, which was a lot less intimidating than I thought it would be (40%), and a research proposal at the end (40%). Overall, some of the bigger assignments take time, but other than that it's a really chill class. Recommend that you start the readings early/break them up into sessions cause that makes discussions better!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"The ability to engage with the course material without the added stress of homework/exams made it so much more enjoyable of a learning experience. For anyone with a remote interest in the subject, you'll be glad you took this course."
,,,,,,,,,,,Prof Miller is an amazing instructor & this is such an interesting class! It's almost entirely discussion–based & the workload is extremely manageable. I would so recommend to anyone interested in stress or the immune system. One of my favorites I've taken in the psych department
,,,,,,,,,,,Good course for exploring some conceptual questions about neuropsych and public health! Discussion style class with debate presentations in 2nd half made it feel fairly relaxed and open–ended. Professor Miller has some great stuff to offer
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was great! Professor Miller was awesome, and I learned so much. I really liked the debate assignment too"
wnbg,psych,392,spring,Sara Broaders,5.58,5.33,5.42,5.42,5.58,6.99,Very time consuming but rewarding course. Weekly readings are between 100 and 200 pages from various super interesting books. Weekly discussion posts are required and you need to put in a good amount of effort to earn your grade. Also a long final paper based off of your own research which is very time consuming. Take this class if you’re interested in the science behind peoples weird beliefs.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course was a lot of fun! You get to do a lot of fun activities and read about interesting topics. It's a fair amount of work though and the final project kind of hits you hard, so maybe take it not before you're about to graduate."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Class can be fun, but it really depends on who's in the class. Our class was way too big so discussions were really unforced. Broaders tries to facilitate discussion, but making everyone participate comes at the cost of having deeper and engaging conversations. There's a weekly Canvas post and a long final paper. The guidance for the paper is very limited, and grading feels like it's based on ""vibes"" rather than any standard. Nonetheless, if you're looking for a good row 2 class, this is a solid option."
,,,,,,,,,,,"Great class. The workload is hefty with 200 pages of reading sometimes expected a week, but the course material is extremely interesting. The smaller class size made for some fun discussions and the 3 hours flew by each week, never felt like we were wasting time. The final paper/experiment is a little intense, but a great opportunity to apply what you've learned in Psych major/minor/etc. Broaders' personality is pretty well–known w/ Psych students – some enjoy it and some hate it but I think this is a course she really loves teaching and you can clearly see that."
,,,,,,,,,,,please take this class. It is not an easy A at all but you wont even care about what you get in this class as you will learn so much and have such a great time. Broaders is so knowledgable and in the long class discussions (which fly by) she brings snacks for us. The readings are very interesting and fun. Only thing is that she is a picky and inconsistent grader for the Discussion questions which are due before class and are the main portion of your grade. So do not wait till the night before class to do them as they need to be good as you never get any help besides some feedback on them.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This class is great!! I learned a ton about how beliefs work, became more compassionate for those with different beliefs than I, and learned to question my own beliefs (and some aspects of science). Prof. Broaders also brought food every class, which was awesome. There is a discussion question every week that is 250w max, which makes it much easier, but it comes with a lot of reading. Luckily the reading is usually engaging and interesting, so it wasn’t too hard to get through for me. We also do fun in–class activities like the rubber hand illusion, ghost hunting, and also watched a good number of movies. I was excited to come to class every week! Also there’s a final paper that’s just an APA study, basically what you did in research methods but applied to this topic. This class was a super fun end to my Northwestern career, highly recommend."
,,,,,,,,,,,"I enjoyed this class for the topic, the instruction, and community. I was interested in learning about human belief systems, their formation, and roles in daily life. I took away a lot about those things from the course content. I enjoy courses taught by Prof Broaders because they are challenging and make you work hard. Finally, the seminar style made it so the class had a nice community – we shared snacks and activities each week. I did not like that we did not talk about the content during class time. We did maybe a third of the time but the rest was filled with activities or work toward the final project. I found it awkward that the final project was far from the course content but that speaks to my personal preference for research paper assignments over actual research projects. The timeline to complete the final project was tight but manageable since we had been talking about it all quarter."
,,,,,,,,,,,too many readings reiterating the same thing. would have liked more flexibility with questions (ex: lowest grade dropped). also super annoying to do all the readings only to not talk about them at all in class besides in the first few weeks.
,,,,,,,,,,,"This course ROCKS. As far as Row 2 courses go, take this one. Professor Broaders is an incredible lecturer, and three hours goes by very quickly in this class. Very manageable workload since just once a week. Definitely take!"
